BODY:
first and foremost, a great big heart-felt thanks to <a href="http://godspoken.net"> angela </a> for letting me use her server for this; i despise those xanga/livejournal/blogging/othercrap etc. services, though i get the feeling i'm using one right now... ¬.¬

for those of you who do not know, this is the page where you can find everything that i see and experience while in japan - i'll do my best to keep out the blogging-type of atmosphere, but in a nut shell this is my daily workings and what not since i realize calling/visiting japan isn't exactly the cheapest thing in the universe.

also, by reading this paragraph you have agreed to my terms and rules stated below, as well as forfeiting your eternal soul to me.

basically i'm just going to let you all know that i do swear when i type - nothing quite equals the emotional experience of '...shit.' - and there will be some randomness (japanese text for instance) that if you have no idea what i'm referring to, then it doesn't pertain to you [target audience and what not]. all in all enjoy your reads.

and just on a random note, if i ever feel so motivated as to actually learn html [you all know this probably won't happen], i'll make minor adjustments here and there along the way. i have a year right? ^^

and yes i'm aware i make a lot of spelling errors, but this is my 'blog' so :Þ.

ok, it's 3:20 am, and i'm not packed yet, and files are still being transferred, and i can honestly tell you that i think it's finally hit me. not when this week was counting down or the final orientations or the good wishes and what not i've received in the last month and a half, but i think it boiled down to this; saying goodbye to the two people that mean the most in my life (not counting family of course), as in if i didn't know any better, i would believe without a doubt that we were brothers.

i can't imagine what awaits me in the near future, let alone in the next 5 hrs till i have to go to the airport, the 8 hrs where i will board a flight for 11 hrs or so, and the next 365 days where i will spend them in a country i've never been to and at best tried to pick up two years of it's language in the last four years of my life.

i know i promised that i would keep this to the minimum of blogging, but i think i'll make this one entry an exception. i look back from this moment thinking of all the great times i've had, knowing that i'm about to have the time of my life. i have no regrets.

so yeah, finally here, and it still hasn't quite hit me yet. sooo, in a nut shell. it's hot. it's humid. i stepped out of the airport, and literally ran 8 miles without losing my breath. or getting any exercise :P it's not so bad here culture shock wise though, i'm just it helps that i'm surrounded by americans and the fact that this really just looks like taiwan... but with katakana and hiragana, so it's not <i>that</i> bad haha.

and just some basic info; orientation is being held at the keio plaza hotel, in shinjuku, a district in tokyo;  tokyo tower is nice... and.. yeah.. it's nice, not quite 40 bucks us to get to the top, but nice. not much going on, got some ghetto-hole-in-the-wall 4 dollar ramen, and 2 dollar kirin (still better than the us) and found an electronics store that puts everything in the us to shame; they have all the games never released, and all the games before the us (/joy); as well as the advent children limited edition box set (~295 us and one day earlier 9/14 vs. 9/15). other than that, i refuse to leave the hotel when it's broad daylight. humidity and wearing wool is not a good mix.

big thanks to mike tai and his mom though for seeing me off to the airport, sorry it wasn't much to see, but not sleeping the night before isn't exactly the best. nor is an 11 hr flight with 2 hrs of customs and a 2 hr bus ride through rush hour to get to our hotel in humid weather is so joyus.

ok i gg, bbl to post more, jana

ok, well not really haha; i missed the first meeting ever with my boss boss... good one eh? today's the last day of orientation, and after falling asleep in one of the seminar's i attended, i took some time off to just sit back and watch some tv that i can't understand.

we leave for our respective cities tomorrow - on a pleasant 3 - 4 hr bus ride vs. the sexy 45 minute shinkansen (bullet train) - but hey, it's been fun. though i do wish i had more time to meet more people. it's pretty neato though, met really great people from the uk, from australia, new zealand, canada, hawaii, and what not - and yes horace there are a few attractive girls here, but i think i'll just leave it at that haha. and yes i have pictures. /hosesoffhorace.

sorry i haven't had a chance to upload any photos, i think i either lost my camera battery charger/left it at home/put it in another bag that's already in my apartment in fuji; two are ok... one is rather bad. i promise though i'll get them all up by the time i figure out how to get some inet in my apartment.

on another note, mom you have to turn <i>on</i> the computer at home to let me call you, but just to let you know i'm alive and well, and nothing is the way it shouldn't be. i'm fine.

alright, nothing more from this jet-lagged gaijin with a monkey in his pocket (i'll explain later), genkide minasan.

uttered by some weird prostitute as my friends and i were walking by haha. shane and i seriously started wondering if she was a woman or not... anyways. last day of tokyo orientation, and tomorrow we head out. we spent the night at some hole in the wall yakitori (i think) shop and some how ran up a tab of 50 bucks :\ though it's for the experience... right? i mean who can put a price on ghetto prostitute in the yakuza district? (i forget what it's really called, but they're all over the streets).

not much happened today except we actually sat in a real alt (assisstant language teacher) lesson plan for high schools which was rather nifty. they even invited five high school students (all girls, and 'no' i'm still winning bets 5 and 6), i ended up getting bored and passing notes with one of them (her name was rie, and 'no' 5 and 6 are  not lost causes).

anyways, we, me, chris, shane, went to the top of the government buildling and got a tremendous view of the city (at night) and i know i'll get pictures up asap, i just can't find my battery charger at the moment and only have one battery left for taking pictures :P tomorrow we head out to town at 9 am and then onto more prefecture orientation.

so some interesting factoids about japanese hotels that i've learned:
1. don't try to examine anything in the minibar. there is a gate that closes which means even if you don't drink it, you'll have to pay for it :[.
2. the 43rd floor has a view from the bathroom that is better than most in the hotel.
3. door close REALLY closes the door!!
4. japanese people think americans love french fries for breakfast.
5. you can cancel floors you accidentally press in the elevator.
6. the handicap elevator is the only elevator that goes to every floor.
7. at every floor, you are humbly welcomed to the [insert any floor].

hope everything is going well back home.

in town! well.. yeah, but in town! /welcome fuji-shi! on one note, my predecessor is a slob haha; he told me that he had cleaned the apartment before i left... so upon exploring i find mysterious cupboard that upon opening... had four to five bags of cans and plastic bottles fall out... the fridge was a mess with a random cup of coconut milk... molded over, with a piece of saran wrap on it to... prevent it from molding right? and to top it all off, a lovely futon that is filled with brown spots and some other things i'd just rather spare you all from reading. 

anyways, i just had dinner with my supervisor and two english teachers and toured the school today,  i'll elaborate more later, i really need to unpack :P. anyways, i'll get pictures up faster than i thought i would since i 'found' inet here haha. hope things are going well back home, be safe, i'll be back laters.

today was a long day. it started with giving my introduction to most of the teaching staff in yoshiwara commercial high school... which i hear made a fairly decent impression because it was in japanese /cheer. unfortunately school doesn't officially start till the beginning of september, so i'm really just sitting around and trying to meet the sensei's that are here. i hear some jets actually get to work with other jets in the same school, which is nice to a degree. however i still believe that the potential i have now can definately be better than that sort of experience, however it can also be worse (it's looking good so far!). i also had my first english teachers meeting... that was in japanese.

the rest of the day was really spent just running errands for paperwork and what not. i went to city hall to get my alien registration card which requried a passport photo... so we had to do that as well. the irony is that throughout the application process, jet asks for at least 938274290350923852 passport photos; i'm just surprised they somehow ran out. continuing on, watanabe san (no relation to ken i think) as well as tokita sensei and i went to get me a hanko, and finally an attempt at my tax filings (which failed).

really tired after today, i'll write more later, take cares everyone.

BODY:
today felt really good. i got speak to my moom and mike; nothing like familiar voices to break culture shock out of you heh. so apparently the restaurant i went to for dinner last night is really well known for it's ramen.. at least kurebashi sensei thinks so haha. for lunch today she took me to a really nice soba shop; though it's rather far, you guys have to come try it when you come down. she's also taken me to a real nice unagi shop and even taken me to try eel liver... tastes like beef tendon.

on an even lighter note, it's rather amusing when the sensei's speak to me in english. for instance, i was trying to see if anyone knew if i could get my powerbook online at the school. a grouup of 3 sensei's gathered around me; an english teacher, a soccer coach, and i... can't quite remember the last  one. anyways, after much deliberation in japanese (i couldn't catch a word), i finally hear them draw to a conclusion (ok i understook that part). one finally turns to me and they all have this satisfied expression on their faces as the one calmly says to me, 'i know how to say this!' i eagerly smile back and await the answer. 'i don't know...' and they all had a good laugh about that one, well i as well.

anyways, today kurebashi sensei took me as well to try and get my bank account setup. as they asked about alien registration papers, i gladly handed it to them thinking nothinig could be wrong. little do i realize, the clerk at city hall yesterday was too lazy to 'officially' write my address into the second page of the fat booklet that they stapled to my once compact passport (this cost 300yen to remedy i might add... that i had to pay for /shakesangryfist! damn, not even driving horace :P).

upon return to school, the bank actually was there and we were able to get the preliminary paperwork set up /woo. and i don't know if most of you know about this, but a lot of japanese paperwork is not so much signed, but is confirmed with an impression of a hanko, seal, of said person's name. to kurebashi sensei's surprise... when she applied my hanko, she couldn't read it.. because the engraver had made it sideways lol. but that's not what got me... for the next 10 minutes the entire office went around and thoroughly examined the small wooden item as if it's the most interesting in the world. it was just my name... in katakana, and sideways.

after the ordeal, i returned to the teacher's room on the third floor, where... i forgot his name, but i learned he liked manga. to my surprise i took the opportunity to learn of what manga it was (cause he looked 40+). it was about a guy who cooks for his family... there are also 91 volumes of said manga... (going strong i might add and VERY popular) and not only that.. but that sensei has all volumes.. including the limited edition volumes). i.. just have no comment. oh yeah. it's the only manga he reads. /worry.

on a pleasant thought, fukushima sensei offered to take me wherever i needed to go, and even rides home everyday because it was on his way home (which is really nice). it's just that it took him about 30 minutes to say this. don't get me wrong, him speaking in english is a good thing! it's my job right? promoting english and what not... but wow, mike, this was worse than what happened at frys lol. all in all today was a good day, i'm about to head off to go drinking with jets within the area, i'll be back to write a little more.

'hey bob, i'm off to take my break and get a fag or two...'

yeah.. that was just, just great. sorry, <i>yes</i> i'm aware of how immature this is, but how can anyone pass an opportunity like this?

BODY:
today's goal for the most part, was slowly transitioning this aptartment to my own. and for the most part it's gone really well. i asked kurebayashi sensei to help me in the morning sometime between 9 - 10... she arrived at 10:30 haha. anyways, after quickly drawing the conclusion that everything bryan (pred) has left me was not out of generosity, but more out of laziness, we quickly junked everything and headed out to by more supplies... well, new supplies at least (and on a random note, bryan had a <i>lot</i> of body wash... >.>

anyways, todays adventure started with the 100yen shop (little less than a buck). and i gotta say, as ghetto as the dollar stores are in the us, there's some pretty nice stuff here. i got me a bucket. well amongst other things; cleaning supplies, small trash can, seat covers, etc. anyways, it continued with a trip to the ikea of japan, casa, which has the prices to boot. but they're one up on ikea; they sell clothes too. now that i think about it, every store i've been to sells clothes. even the super markets! and people are buying them! what... is... happening? everywhere kinda feels like walmart, but minus the ghetto-ness.

oh, and beef is just ridiculously expensive... well everything is ridiculously expensive. it's a dollar us per orange, it's two bucks for a fourth of spinach that you can get for less than a dollar, it's 20 bucks for a cantalope! (someone ship me some produce please kthxbye!) oh yeah, two thinly cut beef strips, imagine just slightly thicker than the beef used for hot bot, is 15 bucks (i'm rounding down too). diana, come here and procreate :P do it! please? :D beefy.

and this happened right around now... but does anyone else find it funny that kurebayashi sensei (who's 56+) is teaching me bad words (which i already knew...) in japanese? ^^ 

like an old man sitting into his bath, this place is starting to feel like home to me. i just need to clean up after my pred a bit - spent 4700yen ~ 45-46 bucks - and i think we'll be there soon. the whole thinking in japanese isn't as hard anymore, though unfortunately i find myself repeating the same phrases over and over again; this might be the result of me banging my head in the morning on my bathroom door-roof thing (i mean it's weird how my apt is the only place i need to duck :\).

i'm actually rather pleased with how well things are going. well except for a few things. i was going to meet up with some other jets in fujinomia station when, right as i get to the bus station and recognize the bus i want to get on, iti leaves... /sigh. so much for that one. though in all honesty, i'm a little exhausted for going around all day and getting supplies.

back to progress, so so far i've found a really good unagi shop, soba shop, ramen place, a dessert shop (that was today), figured out the bus station (sorta), the jr line (sorta as well), and am slowly getting the hang of going through the boonies to school. /woo. not bad right?

so two small final thoughts. first, post comments orz, my parents don't even know how to work a computer without me teaching them how to (no offense mom and dad, but it's true :P). secondly, tomorrow my supervisor's going to be in a swimming tournament, and i'll hopefully get to attend. be good all (especially obasan!)!

as i might have said earlier, today was the day i was supposed to go watch my supervisor and other teachers in our school compete with the city of fuji. to be honest i was rather excited. i mean this is all out competition between some formidable (age 28-40) women here. /roar. anyways, it's a really nice facility too [pictures later i promise!] and all the local schools (elementry to highschool) came to participate. now a quick note of how things worked. before a competition begins, the names and respective schools are displayed for their respective lanes. and after all scores are recorded, the names disappear and repeat for the next set of students / teachers / whomever.

also apparently there are records that can be broken. and a lot were broken today which i thought was nifty. till i learned the truth...:

me: wow these students must be great swimmers with all these world records being broken!
sensei: um... they're not really world records...
m: oh.. then japan records!
s: no... not quite...
m: um... prefecture records? (a prefecture is like a state in the us)
s: ... how about city?
m: ....[no.. comment].

so... their race was the seventh of the day. i was on the edge of my seat. so far there were all grades so far racing, and it looked really interesting and to be honest i was interested in how my teachers would fair. names from race six go down... and <b>one</b> name goes up. yoshiwara commercial high school. as you can imagine... i was jumping for joy /sarcasm. yeah... it was just them. and i don't mean they used the other part of the olympic sized swimming pool for something else either. it was <i>just</i> them [i have this recorded as a short avi file]ˆˆ. 

afterwards the four sensei's came up and i just had this look...¬¬.

me: nice "race" you had there sensei.
sensei: yeah it was great wasn't it!
m: yes... had it actually been a race...
s: hey but we won didn't we ˆˆ?
m: on technical....
s: a win's a win! details details!
m: ....[for teh win!] right...

but in all honesty it was great; they got medals and everything lol [have a pic of that too, promise i'll get these up soon!]. 	anyways, after a few races, my supervisor (who i sometimes interchange with 'sensei' cause she is one) got rather hungry and headed outside to get some of those rice ball things. now these rice balls.. i thought were filled with some sort of meat variety [they say 'chicken' 'tuna' 'eel' etc. on them]. anyways, i got that and a small sandwich, and sensei grabbed two herself and two bottles of water. opening them was another story. i, the american way i guess, figured to unwrap the entire thing and begin devouring thus so. but upon doing so, i learned that i had a ball of rice (well triangle really) and a sheet of seaweed enclosed in the outer wrapper still /huh. naturally this caused my supervisor to laugh hysterically at me.

it's actually rather ingenious how to unwrap these:

1. there is a red string that you pull, exposing the seaweed and separating the wrapper into two parts.
2. after separating sead wrapper, pull the two pieces off in their respective direction, and the rice ball falls gently into the seaweed.
3. wrap seaweed in said riceball and enjoy.

here was my way.

1. unwrap the entire thing till you have a ball of rice sitting in the wrapper with the seawead inaccessable still in the outer wrapper.
2. wait for the nod of approval as you whip out your pocket knife and prepare to tackle the task at hand with excessive force.
3. watch as your supervisor laughs hysterically at you for at least a minute before showing you the error of your ways. 

on a positive note, or more upbeat anyways, apparently one of the teachers on the team is a world record holder for the 50m breast stroke. 

so to recap some of the highlights of today:

1. a 50's (give or take a few years) woman swam the breast stroke for 50m... who then had to be helped out of the pool by two grown men...
2. a 70's (same as above) swims the 50m freestyle faster than my sensei... ¬¬
3. and finally, a fifth grader who swam the butterfly 50m, is able to, well, swim the butterfly 50m farther than me... i just kept that tidbit to myself though haha.
4. the mascot for the prefecture is a giant mount fuji with arnold arms named fujippi. the logo in front of the rec area is of fujippi 'swimming.' i thought that was great. no pictures though :\.

at the end of it all, they all wanted to go to a nice family restaurant to celebrate their 'victory.' i, eager and excited at japanese family restaurants (cause i've never been), had to ask, 'oh? which one?'and the reply....:

'have you ever been to denny's?' she said.

i... have... no... freakin... comment. it's nice to fly almost 8,000 miles and endure 9 months of applications... to eat at a fine establishment like... denny's. yeah. yeah.... (ala mike wu).

lastly, kurebayashi sensei helped me figure out the laundry machine, and loaned me towels, and brought me watermelon, and would have cleaned my kitchen if i hadn't noticed, and brought me the correct garbage bags to use... i figure if i give her my immortal soul that just might be enough. maybe. take cares everyone!

I hear Denny's is actually quite a ritzy restaurant in Japan. Not like, "$50 an entree"-ritzy, but certainly more upscale than their American counterparts.

well ritzy... if you count a+b+c = 1050yen, or the fact that they serve steaks... the size of a quarter... then yeah lol. to be honest, i`m avoiding the american restaurants; i still don`t think i flew 8k in milage to eat at mcdonalds :P and yes they are yummy... but they`re just rice :3

BODY:
i showed up to work today, thinking i'd be late (woke up at 7:43am)... except when i got to school (on time!), there were say... 3 people? the principal and vice principle weren't even there lol. none of the english teachers were there either. but i still got one thing done! all the pictures have been sorted and that means i'm going to be able to upload them soon (possibly tomorrow sometime at school, or tonight if i get around to it.).

heh it took about 3 hrs or so to get them all ready.

anyways, not many interesting things happened today; while thumbing through some of my pictures, the sensei's that were there noticed a picture of horace (it was actually /shakeangryfist pic, which i'll upload), and noted that he had a nice car. after showing them the car horace drives, everyone thought he was a rich bastard haha. 'okanemochi, aitsu wa.' the conversation that ensued was one of the highlights of my day.

supervisor: so jeff, what car do you have?
me: oh.. i.. don't have a car.
s: oh, so which car do you want?
m: oh! /grin one second! /surfsthewebtryingtofindapictureofag35
s /whilei'msearching: oh is it my car! :D (she drives a golf..)
m: ... ... ... no. 

now you don't need to know much about cars to know that the last thing i'd ever want to drive would be a volkswagon hatchback. right horace? anyways, i need to slap horace. because while this was happening, they, about 3 english teachers, were amused that i could chat on aim, search the web, and carry a conversation with them all at the same time. at which time they started to read my aim conversations. and then they stumbled upon horace (you bastard)'s window.

me: [random point in previous conversation].
m: oh hey my sensei's are trying to read our conversation!
horace: oh shiet really? 
h: HAY A GIRL!
h: penis.
m: !!! aaaaaaa i'm serious, they're actually reading this!
h: hahaha ok ok. penis.

yeah.. something like that... and i have no comment. i hate you horace. ok just that.

ah yes, hara sensei took me to this great 300 yen udon/soba shop near the ghetto pos of a train station we have. it's actually really good and they give you a fair amount (enough to fill you up). hopefully he'll take me to other cheap places (he really likes the local shops heh). yamaguchi sensei said there's a nice little italian place right outside the school (tomorrow's mission) as well as another soba place (might be the same as kurebayashi sensei's) that is only 5 minutes away. so yeah.. a decent amount to look forward to; the only thing i worry is that i have no idea how i'd get to these places on my own ;P. 

oh, and on another note; remember when i told you my predecessor cleaned up the entire apt for me before he left? yeah... watanabe san and i as well as yamaguchi sensei and (i really can't remember his name, but he's really cool, like an ojisan) helped me clean out a truck load of garbage. fun stuff. anyways, i'm off to grab dinner, tomorrow is keitai hunting!

BODY:
today has started as any other really; grab either the 7:40 or 8 am bus to school, sit down, and begin surfing the web heh. yes, sorry i don't post pictures up while i'm at school, my excuse is that i use the school's computer when i'm at school, and i use my own at home. but they're all ready to be uploaded and what not, honest heh.

my supervisor and yamaguchi sensei were away at a tennis tournament today, so i was pretty much left to my own fruition. and being that everyone is on summer vacation, i'm usually the only one there... anyways. today was japanese dictionary hunting day (i remembered the website you showed me ito sensei, and it's still half off - kainasai~^^) and started asking my other sensei friends if they can help further explain to me if it explains anything in english.

this took at least 30 minutes, in addition to 10 sensei's. 

as 11:30 rolls around... still not many sensei's at school, and the vice principal thought it might be a good idea to take me to the 'fry's' of japan, yamada denki ya, to search for a dictionary. ozawa sensei offered to take me (the one with the world record in the 50m breast stroke AND the city record of the 50m backstroke! /applause), and i of course with nothing to do (mike wu) went along with.

now what would you suspect a world record holder to listen to in her isuzu suv? rock? trance? rap? oh no no no my friends.

the phantom of the opera. and not <i>just</i> the phantom of the opera... no no no. in japanese.

anyways... when i got back, i needed to make a phone call. but before i used the phone, i asked the vice principal if i could use it (i felt it was appropriate).

so there's something you have to know about the vice principal.

i never get his name right.

and this is very bad.

i've called him kyoto sensei, akito sensei, akyoto sensei, akimato sensei, akimamoto sensei just hoping that maybe i'd get it right, and he's just simply smile and nod and acknowledge that i'm right (for once :P).

so.

this time i start walking towards him with a questino in hand, and as soon as he sees me he begins writing on a post it in front of me. without looking upwards at me, he hands me said postit and resume working. now i thought this postit was something to do with my orientation. or perhaps advice i was looking for throughout the day. or maybe even a great recipe for curry. oh no.

as i take the note. it had one thing written on it. and you guessed it. <i><b>akimoto </b></i>.

thankfully at that time, goto sensei was leaving for the day, and as he told me 'i'll see you tomorrow.' i corrected him in saying i won't be here. so he said 'day after then.' corrected again telling him i won't be here then either. he finally stopped and turned to me and said, 'well why not?' i told him i had another orientation to go to and that it was mendokusai (troublesome as i understand it best). a group of four sensei bursted out laughing saying that it was very well said, and i sounded like a true japanese person.

and then they said i shouldn't say that, not to a superior anyways lol. so now i said in english, 'orientation is a pain in the ass.' this struck a cord amongst the four sensei's. they asked me to teach them what 'pain in the ass' meant. this was my poor attempt: oshiri no itai, oshiri ni itai... oshiri ga itai etc etc. (i'm sure i got it wrong ito sensei, and yes i know 'iwanaide' to imasu). so i think what ensued had to be the best. keep in mind.. this is all in japanese, except for the first part of the last line.

sensei 1: ohhhh i know what that is! it's when you fart right (hand motions and everything)?
me: not.. quite...
sensei 2: oohhhh that's when you have bad gas!
me: um... not really...
sensei 3: is it when you have to poop?
me: um... no
sensei 4: so.. it's pain.. in.. the... oshiri?

i had to laugh. that was just comedic gold. you have to remember that these are grown adults. but it was a lot of fun. i tried telling them it was similar to uzai (annoying), one even started to move like a fly, to show me what it was. yeah... fun stuff. i told them it was a very colloquial phrase that you can use among friends and not to your superiors. right as i said that the vice principal smiles and yells from his desk across the room, 'what're you all talking about?'

all five of us: betsuni! (nothing special)

after work i spent some time with another jet, susie (from the uk), trying to get a cell phone (which was way over our heads), as well as ramen at the tenchijin ramen shop (the people of heaven and earth... i think) and had a beer chilling in her apartment (30 min walk away). and yes she has a bf, and no she's not my type.

so as i said earlier, i'll be away for the next three days at another orientation, yipee /sarcasm. i'll see you all on saturday the 13th, or friday the 12th. ja. supposedly there's a big party friday night in shizuoka city.

BODY:
today was the first day of the second orientation. with one fun fun looking forward to super spectacular fact. we were going to take the bullet train to get there. oh that's right. bullet train. b-u-l-l-e-t-t-r-a-i-n.

after meeting up with susie and brian, we headed towards shin fuji station on our ways towards kakegawa station - about 30 minutes (and 30 dollars... one way, orz) by bt, one and a half hours (13 dollars, also one way) by normal (not bullet fast) train.

unfotunately though... 0 - 250kmh+ is not as fast as you would imagine. you feel nothing. in fact it's so smooth you can keep walking around the train while it sped up. /sigh. though when it flys through a station, it roars. it's an inspiring sound, take my word for it heh.

with the rest of the fuji crew aboard, we rush off to kakegawa, and eventually ikoino station where we walked on foot to the asunaro center... in asunaro of course. now up till this day we had received countless emails from our prefectual advisor that this was a <i>professional</i> orientation where we had to dress business attire (for the first day at least) throughout the entire first day.

have you ever worn a full suit and everything on a day with 90 degree weather with the humidity to match? yes. it's not pleasant.

so the purpose of getting there early was simply so that we could change into suits in a cooler atmosphere rather than enduring the hour or so of travel time in said weather. it <i>sounded</i> like a great idea. and made sense as well. however once we got to asunaro center, we learned one, slightly important fact.

the center was not air conditioned.

anyways. opening ceremonies started, and as a requirement, all of the staff members have to reveal an embarassing story to all of the jets from shizuoka prefecture. and i don`t think anything quite beats this story (you have to picture with with engrish...).

jte: so this one time, i went to karaoke bar... who likes karaoke bar? (lots of people raise their hands) and i get really into it, and i start jumping up and down! except when i did that, i cut the cheese.

now nothing quite beats the phrase `cut the cheese` let alone it being said in english. i think it`s safe to say, the entire room was dying... 

other great stories were of slippers falling in squatting toilets, drunkards, and a women running around asking people how to play with 金球... i am not translating that one btw. if you get it, feel free to ask me. but yeah... no. and for those who are curious, the correct pronunciation of that game is 狆球 (i might have gotten the kanji wrong on the first one).

the rest of the day was simply workshops (i do have pictures), some safety presentations, dinner (which was boring, except for the way you clean up afteryourself, pictures YES)and a bit of wandering around... until i had to take a shower. now the shower is on the third floor, also, the onsen (fake) is also on the third floor. there`s just one small thing about them that everyone fails to mention to you.

they`re in the <b>same</b> area.

yeah... and i`m going to leave it at that. and no, nothing gay transpired. period. and `no` i do NOT have pictures. on a side note... (i was not here when this happened btw, and don`t you believe otherwise!) when the um... you know... other side of the tracks... those guys walked in... the entire room cleared out haha.

moving on! after a jet get together, everyone retired to their dorms, and i ended up having a conversation between andrew, brent, and me. the interesting thing about brent, is that he`s 27, and he`s traveled the world. by himself. he`s borded planes to destinations where he knew nobody, and all he carried with him were the things on his back. i was impressed. go huge or to go home he`d say to me.

you`re damn right.

comforting isn`t it? thank you kjell (pronounced `shell`)

sometimes it`s really hard to choose which primal urge you want to satisfy; sleep or hunger... a never ending battle in my opinion. though today i decided to let sleep win, and thus skipped breakfast.

it wasn`t till when i got downstairs in time to get a cup of tea, that i realized i paid for breakfast... nice four dollar cup of tea that was...

anyways... more workshops today... blah blah blah, /oriented to death. neat little thing after dinner was that we got to view japanese skits (i have a video of one... though the best ones were in the beginning... amazing what a well timed `shit` does for a skit... or multiples anyways), as well as a tea ceremony (well a 30 minute version of a four hour ceremony), and a Q&A session where that quote comes from in the title... yeah.

oh yes, and this night jet`s gathered in the cafeteria... for drinking games seen here [photos up soon!].

unfortunately this is about to the extent i can remember... :P

today was the last day of our second orientation within japan. and though i dreaded it for a long time (orientations are not fun... let alone they've so far been rather pointless), i have to say i'm somewhat reluctant to leave this one. before you all get any ideas. it's NOT because of the public baths. bastards.

it's been a fun three days getting to know the people around your area better in addition to meeting new people and getting a better grip of those around you. anad yes, british accents are fun. or british slang is. such as minging, wanker, tosser, pissed, etc. and yes, they're even more fun to say <i>in</i> british accents! as the final meeting gathered together, we were able to see some of the exceptional self introductions (yours truly half assed it so badly... yeah... i wasn't one of the exceptional haha) and a good friend of mine, kieran was chosen. i don't want to spoil it, but i got it (well i need to get it from brian / kent) on video.

a great surprise thouh as we exited asunaro center. the weather was cool, with a pleasant breeze and lo and behold... humidity of zero! the cause? a thunderstorm off in the distance. i haven't seen rain in awhile to be honest. as the clouds rolled towards us, we all could see the inevitable confrontation of shiz jets vs. the rain. i think the rain won that one.. maybe it's just me.

it poured.

all of the shiz jets sheltered into the nearby shelters, including lauren [pic here]. and that would also explain why i look like this with micah and chanel [pic again]. we finally get to kakegawa station, and here arrives my highlight of this trip; one of the jets lost their passport, cell phone, money, and all certain things that would be a rather, well bad, if one were to lose them all. this jet lost them all. and unfortunately he, as well as everyone else, couldn't speak japanese to ask for help. and that's when everyone looked at me...

(ito sensei, you'd be proud :) )

don't get me wrong. i was a bit nervous. i mean i can say stupid things in japanese and random comments... and usually i converse with people who know a bit of english so i can get away with it... but the station manager knew no english.. let alone my vocabulary (sumimasen ito sensei) has gone down the drain. i figured i could give it a shot, right?

after talking with the station manager for a few minutes, and finally remembering that i wrote our prefectual advior's (darren) cell on my [now falling apart] paper change holder, not purse, holder - we were able to locate the jet's lost valuables and make our train. yay. jeff 1, language barrier 0!

as the fuji crew, well parts of the fuji crew, brian, me, lauren, john, and doug, got on the train, fatique finally kicked in. we decided to pass the shizuoka party (don't forget we're lugging our luggage too) and head home for a somewhat quiet dinner with just the five of us. this turned out to be a lot of fun, we went to an enkai, watami, and ate our fill of apetizers and alochol. fun times.

and as i arrived back home, i promptly passed out for the next 12 hours or so :).

after an hour of cleaning my kitchen floor... (not pleasant) there are only three words that can pick a guy's spirits up.

100 yen sushi.

quite possibly one of the greatest things ever invented. as brian, lauren, john, and i meet at yoshiwara chuo eki, we head down towards kappa sushi (aka 100 yen sushi shop). here's how it works: 100 yen per plate (with a 5 yen tax) and the most expensive items are 150 yen (with a 7 yen tax). a conveyer belt rolls around the entire restaurant, and re-enters the kitchen (so you bastards who sit by the opening can't steal the best ones). a picture rolls down with a few rolls behind it, tea is self service at your table with it's own hot water pump, as well as wasabi and soy sauce. to top it off, if you don't see anything you want, you can press a button, order it, and it will come on the conveyer belt with your table number on it. oh, and each piece of sushi has two pieces.

how great is this?

no really... how great is this?

it's not even that bad, see: todai, i mean they even had toro (tuna belly). cheap tuna belly is still tuna belly... even if it's from the sickly rejected tuna bellys... still tuna belly yos!

i have to say. saturday night was great. good times, good people, good food. john has a great irish accent, brian spot on scottish - with the whistle too!, and lauren does a great red neck impression. i can't tell you how much fun we all had. and of course with us mimicing accents, the jokes were sure to come... sooo....

q: what does every redneck say before they die?
a: hey boys, lemme show ya somethin!

and then things got kinda ghetto lol.

brian: holy shit, we need to yank them tea bags yea?
me: omg that's just ghetto... we need to have our dignity here if anything.
b: well.. yeah we still do. i mean it's 'all you can eat...' not 'all you can eat... here.'

i think we died for five minutes.

anyways, after the damage was done... lauren ate 5 plates (two were desserts, and yes she claimed she was <i>real</i> hungry, see: ellin after bio ap), john had 7,brian 10, and myself 15... [another pic here, but i need to get them from brian heh]. anyways, with full stomachs, we headed home, and i promptly passed out... again.

BODY:
chan naro!! finally get to work on today's entry! today, as usual, i got up around 7, and headed towards the bus station to catch the 8 am to school. there's something you have to note though. you see the bus has two distinct marks next to certain times. a red 'x' means that it doesn't run on sundays or holidays. and black 'x' means that it doesn't run on saturdays or holidays.

both of the buses i usually take, 7:40 or 8, have the red x. sooo yeah. moving on, i get to the bus station around 7:50 and wait patiently. standing their ready to go, 8 rolls right on through... in fact it rolls on through for 10 minutes... and japanese public transit is the best in the world (as in always on time). so... what could i do?

i can call my supervisor, tell her i'm going to late, except doing so takes me away from the loading point, let alone out of range if the bus were to come. however if i show up late with no explanation i think that's just as bad right?

so i call.

me: sensei, i've been waiting, the bus isn't here, i might be late this morning...
sensei: oh it's ok, don't worry if you come late.
m: are you sure?

now something you have to know... japanese people usually, <i>usually</i> will never say how they truly feel (cultural thing); they don`t want to hurt/offend their listener (which is a good habit if you think about it). so i personally interpreted this as 'yeah, get your ass here as soon as possible before the vice principal has your nuts on a platter for lunch.'

the next bus was at 9 am. it was 8:15 or so at the time... i decided to hop a cab. and i mean i know it's not the smartest move, but i figured getting there earlier than 9:20 would be better than getting there... at well 9:20, right?

the cab makes record time to school, and arrives at the gates just after 8:20am... i'll be it also at the price of 1330 yen ~ 12 bucks (the bus costs about 2.50 or so)

but hey, i made it somewhat on time right? /strutting

i get upstairs, and as i prepared to face my fate of coming in a few minutes lates, i opened the staff room to find... just akimoto sensei (vice principal... yes, the one who's name i could never get). and maybe i'm not typing this clearly. but i don't mean i opened the door, and he's standing there ready to lecture me. i mean i opened the door, and he's sitting at his desk, alone, with no one else in the room, and i'm just walking in... normally... and 1330 yen poorer...

i apologized to the vice principal for being late, and quietly asked if there was anything special today going on. he told me today was a somewhat national holiday to honor the dead who fought in wwII. /pointstotheflagathalfstaff.

ah... is that all.

then i followed with the next logical question:

me: sensei, let's just say if i were to come in late... would you rather me come in during the morning meetings? or afterwards?
sensei: well i think middle would be best (i'm taking out language barrier difficulties btw, and giving you the gist of a 10 minute conversation that simply expressed this point) if you came during the middle.
m: but wouldn't it be rude if i showed up in the middle?
s: oh but you see that's ok... cause you won't be late.
m: i know i know... but what if....
s: no no you don't quite understand me. you won't be late. right? /grin
m: h....hai.....

ok so he said it more in good humor... but you kind of sense that underlying truth their rigiht? ...right? 

anyways, my supervisor walks in, and after the vp tells another teacher (ozawa sensei, the wr holder and a friend of mine) the whole story she walks over laughing her ass off at me. my supervisor has this face: o.Oa.

ozawa sensei: did you hear what happend to jeff? he took the cab here D:!
supervisor: hahaha didn't i tell you you could be late?
me: ....

i... have... no comment. and yes, i feel tremendously stupid, but i figure i paid 12 bucks for a good story right? .... right? ;\

lunch rolls around, and i, as usual didn't bring an obento - box lunch, was getting rather hungry. i hear ozawa sensei and my supervisor are going out for lunch, and i ask if i can tag along (i hate doing this ;P). of course they said i could and promptly decided on the soba place that kurebayashi sensei took me to last time (you guys have to come here, it's a bit of a walk, but worth it).

this time i opted for udon though. still good i say. anyways, we get into this little conversation about japanese and english, and they get a kick that the obasan who owns the place remembers me and pours me a class of chilled wheat tea on the house (cause she remembered i said it was really good, and it is).

the conversation leads to:

sensei`s: so jeff... where did you learn words like めんどくさい　and what not...
me: anime ^^
s: do you know any others?
m: i... no?
s: ...

so after i exchange the bad words i know in japanese, and them a few bad words in japanese, my supervisor asked if i can cook (well it was more 'did you cook last night?' i just missed... a lot of it :P) and i said i can, and that i make, literally, mom's chinese food. and i said of course i would invite them all over to my apartment for me to cook them a meal heh. after i cleaned it of course (still going).

sup: yeah.. jeff has a real fetish for cleaning.

i nearly spit out my udon.

me: WHAT!!???
s: what? you have a fetish for it. you like it a lot right?

ozawa sensei nods in understanding that i like clean things.

m: um... don't say it like that though... i mean... fetish? i hardly think so...
s: what's wrong with that word? isn't that it?
m: not... quite.. you see fetish is when you....

ozawa sensei searches out the world in my supervisor's electronic dictionary. and i read the description: fetish - an object or habit that drives one into wanting sex.

m: だから、アメリカに言わないで！本当に、悪い言葉ですよ！ (please don`t say that in america, those aren`t good words.)

i point to the definition.

i think the look was priceless... i think the closest i can emote it would be this... O.O;;＜－－－－－－(sweat)! she nearly spit out her udon haha. after all that good wholesome fun, we head back to school, and as we get out, my supervisor tells me she has a change of heart, and is going to take a half day. right then.

that's... just awesome.

after getting home that night, i decide to do a little cleaning after getting dinner - more goodies from pred - and walked around the streets of the yoshiwara district in fuji city. and it`s rather ghetto the more i look at it.

there is a fruit shop, right next to a geisha bar that offers one hour for 4000 yen (36 bucks) so yeah... i think i`ll stick to the quiet chinese restaurant i eat at... 

p.s. to karen. they think i'm rich because they think i always dress nicely haha. aren't you proud?

p.p.s. and karen, everybody wears short sleeved dress shirts with ties... :P

No way I'll believe that Jeff dresses nicely enough that everyone thinks he's rich. By the way, no, you don't have a cleaning fetish (too lazy most of the time to clean), but you do have a clean fetish. Kind of doesn't make sense to me but yeah.

so something i forgot to mention a far whiles back; on the first day i got into town, 8/3, my supervisor bought me a few small things: a small fruit drink, sandwich, pastry, and tea. i opened my refridgerator and still found said items there...

the sandwich is long [expired 8/3 lol] gone... the pastry had a few days left... sooo i ate breakfast for the first time. it wasn`t so bad to be honest, kinda sweet, and moist still. mmmmm.

work started slow today as well. i caught the 9 am bus because i saw that they still considered the 16th as a holiday (or that`s how i interpreted it) so that meant the 7:40 and 8 buses wouldn`t be there this morning... at least i think that was the case. then as 11:40 or so rolled around the building started to shake.

地勢, earthquake heh.

in miyagi ken, about 5 hrs drive from here (if i were back home, think if it hit fresno) there was a weak 6, or 7.2 earthquake that registered. even here we felt about half of that, a strong 3, or 3.6 or so. oh, right, some expalining; in japan there are different ranks of earthquakes that range from 1 - 7. within each level of magnitude there are a +, strong, and a -, weak. i don`t quite understand what any of it means though.

apparently japan is rather over do for a `big one`. they say that a big earthquake happens at least once every 150 years... fun to know we`re on 151 heh. even more impressive is the way that the teaching staff (all two of them) reacted when it happened.

they stopped working. politely said `hey, it`s an earthquake.` waited for it to stop, and then continued working. not bad eh? nobody got under tables, or paniced, or cryed, or fleed in terror. and the world resumed working in about 30 seconds or so.

so anyways, today i was invited to lunch :D my supervisor, ishikawa sensei, kuboto sensei, ozawa sensei, and myself, all drove in kuboto sensei`s lincoln navigator. now i know i haven`t been in japan too long... but this surprised the hell out of me. cause they asked me to sit shotgun, and it was on the right side... but... this is japan, and, thing... left... aaaaaaaaaaa.

we went for ramen! though unfortunately as good as this place was, it`s incredibly far, with no real easy way to get there; so if you all don`t mind a walk...

during lunch was a lot of fun. i was wondering what ねぎそば was... nobody knew how to explain it. it ended up they asked the chef to show it to me; it was shredded and looked like green onions. finally he pulled out the whole thing from the fridge and i just smacked myself in the forehead. and that day i taught everyone in the restaurant that ねぎ meant leek in english.

then they asked me what it meant in chinese...

and i have no freaking clue... (sorry mom). at which time ishikawa sensei asked if i liked 餃子, or pot stickers, and, being chinese and all, of course i do. i tried teaching them what little dragon buns are and that they`re the best. i also promised them that if we went to taiwan i`d show them around (right mike and mike?). then i heard the most unforgivable utterance of words...;

ozawa sensei: 行きたくなかった. (i never wanted to go)

/dies.

oh, and if none of you have noticed through these entries or my aim conversations with you. my english is slowly slowly deterorating. and that`s all fine and good, except i noticed my japanese isn`t really improving. see now that`s no goodo [that was on purpose]. i started noticing them in one my conversations with horace, we were talking about the earthquake and i was mentioning the training we received at orientation:

me: yeah they had this video for us at kakegawa orientation about earthquakes.
m: they have us a copy.
horace: ...

yeah things like that. i think some of my grammar is also getting really ugly in these entries :P on another thought, i`ve been talking a lot with a lot of the teachers here. and secretly i have this hidden agenda to introduce the `l` sound into japanese language.

so i tried to think of one of the hardest words that have both `r` and `l.`

the word(s) for the day: girl. roll.

my supervisor couldn`t do it without laughing. ishikawa sensei gave up but then tried again later after i asked sato sensei (who got it right off the bat believe it or not). and when ishikawa sensei saw my よくやりました～おめでとうございます～ song and dance she tried again. and still my supervisor couldn`t do it without laughing heh. kobuto sensei got it within a few tries too, so you see, it can be done!

ok, first and foremost. the reason i`ve been delaying the picture thing is that i still don`t want to pay for flickr. i don`t care that it`s  2 dollars a month. i`m cheap. period. i will get as many pictures as i can up tonight before i run out of my 20mb free bandwidth. so for the moment let`s try `if you want a pic, ask me, and i`ll email you the full sized one`

or i can just stop being a pansy and cough up some money.

today started off the same as any day; woke up, grabbed the bus at 8 am, and headed off to school. and literally nothing happened till lunch (about 11:10). i decided today that i`d go check out the italian cafe that i keep saying i`m going to go try, except upon reacing the front door

i find that they`re closed...

so what to do what to do. hara sensei told me that there isn`t much around here convenience store wise. and thus i found myself walking down the hill [i`ll get a pic of this] and literally choosing to head left or right. i chose left today.

after finding a small bread and food shop, i head back to school with my lunch, and onigiri, which i opened correctly this time (thaaat`s right!) and marveled at the progress that i`ve made in the last 17 days in japan (baby steps man haha).

back at school, watanabe sensei (he likes the manga about cooking) and fukushima sensei (speaks english at 10 words an hour) marveled at the fact that i brought/bought something like this. oh... which reminds me of a conversation i had with my supervisor about fukushima sensei (really a great guy, i just can`t help giving him a hard time... yes i know it`s fcuked up :P).

me: tokita sensei, i was trying to list the english teachers and i can`t name two of them...
supervisor: oh, did you list sato sensei, yamaguchi sensei, fukushima sensei...?
m: hahahahaha...
s: what`s so funny?
m: fukushima sensei is um... he`s kinda slow at english. i`m surprised he teaches that`s all...
s: it`s ok... he`s kinda slow at japanese too

hahahahaha, isn`t she great? anyways, after lunch i had serious food coma, and decided that perhaps i should walk around the entire school for once in my life... seeing as how i have nothing to do right now. so here`s what i`ve found:

the 一年生 have it rough because their classes are all on the fifth floor. the 二年生 have there classes on the fourth, and the 三年生 have it on the third. on the fourth floor in the annex, the manga club meets. fukunana sensei and sato sensei are incharge of this club; and to be honest i`m quite impressed. though none of the club members want to talk to me because i`m 怖い :P (scary). but there is this one really good artist there [i`ll get a pic] and their manga has some english...

unfortunately...

don`t get me wrong, remember, my job is to promote english! though i had to help them out... when they spell `dreams` as `dremes`... and strangely enough they had `dream` correctly spelled next to it.. i had to help them out. i mean these are actually published works.

on the third floor on the carpeted area, i found a small dance club; they`re all about 5`3 and thought it was funny as hell when they stood next to me. four of them came up to me while five of them sat down to plan the next choreography.

they thought i was a student here at first.

then i told them that i was from america.

then they thought i was a mix between japanese and korean.

then i told them i was chinese...

then they asked if i had a gf (knew this was coming)

i answered truthfully, though i`m starting to wonder how smart that was. one of them commented that if i were lonely i should try to date one of the teachers...

thanks... but not thanks.

finally they showed me their dance so far; which was rather impressive i must say. though it would have been better had they been able to do it with straight faces haha.

also on a somewhat random note, i found out why fukunana sensei seems a little undertheweather these days... she`s pregnant! /happy. and also she and her husband have tough commutes to work. she works here in fuji, and he works in tokyo, they literally live in between the two cities; and that`s maybe an hour drive for both of them each way. but yeah, she`s expecting in november!

BODY:
i didn't go to work today till 10:30. why? because i felt like it? haha. not as if anyone noticed though, nobody was there at 10:30 anyways heh.

when i got to my desk i met up with itou sensei (one of the four... and my itou sensei from ucsd hehe, unfortunately none of them are actually from the city of ito heh). anyways, itou sensei is one of the five teachers who are going to have conversational classes on tuesday mornings with me; which i look forward to because he was really cool to talk to this morning. he's one of the few teachers that live around the yoshiwara area; the other is kurebayashi sensei and apparently our principal.

anyways, he asked me about my parents, and about myself, my daily antics and what not, and then suzuki sensei walks by. suzuki sensei walks up and tells me, 'hey don't believe this guy, he's not normal.'

at first i wasn't quite sure how to interpret this. and then itou sensei started to laugh, and accused suzuki sensei that he's abnormal (and no, suzuki sensei does not drive a suzuki :P). good times. then suzuki sensei tells me that itou sensei is a dangerous man, and that i shouldn't trust him, and i countered with the possibility that suzuki sensei might be the dangerous one... they both got a kick out of that haha (i really don't expect anyone to get this lol).

anyways, fukunana sensei and sato sensei were rather busy today because the manga club had a publishing deadline to meet today (they met it by the way, 3 hrs before school ended heh), and since my supervisor was gone, i took the time to talk with hara sensei about team teaching and what not.

this is when the principal asked me and hara sensei to talk with her. i won't lie. the conversation that insued was long as hell. a lot of it was about my introduction for the school, and a lot of random facts about myself /shrug. personally i think i'm rather boring :P. but afterwards hara sensei and i headed back to the english room.

and that's when hara sensei started laughing.

hara sensei: ahhh i hate talking with the principal!!
me: .... what?! (i did not get that impression at all)
h: haha she talks so long and slow... and about rambles on pointlessly too...
m: well haha.. could you imaginei if she and fukushima sensei (more shit giving :P) got into a furious debate?

haha good times. so finally afterwards, hara sensei and i went to check out the italian cafe nearby; and i'll be honest, it's really good, and even better because of the price you get. after lunch though, sato sensei came to show me our pool. there's something you should know. sato sensei (there are two at my school) has the absolutely sweetest voice you'll ever hear; kind of like a flower, and i'm not exaggerating. but she's a lot of fun to hang around with;

at the pool:
sato sensei: so this is the pool...
me: wow... it's big...
s: yeah, you see that locked fence?
m: /nods
s: yeah don't worry about that... just hop the wall next to it...

i think you really have to see this [i'll get a pic later]. but there is this rather elaboarte fenced gate that is taller than i am and rather elaborate... however directly next to this fenced gate thing... is a wall that's about 4.5 ft high... so yeah...

i spent the afternoon talking with her, and she got a real kick out of reading my im's. she thinks it's funny how americans always seem to be laughing or always seem to respond laughing heh. i think the best had to be was that we were having this conversation with a japanese dictionary webpage open throughout the entire conversation; i'd always say 'ahhh.. wait a sec please...' while i looked up the meaning of a word

except this time before i could say it, she just smiled and motioned towards the computer saying 'douzo!' (at your leisure hahah. i got the biggest kick out of this ; ))

so about the title of the entry; dan dan ni naremasu!

the entire day everyone's started asking me 'naremasu ka.' this literally translates to 'have you gotten used to japanese lifestyles?' and to be honest i was rather, well i wouldn't say 'moved,' but it was nice to see that people notice when i'm there or not and notice that i'm trying to fit in  (i guess no more 10:30am work days :P). watanabe sensei (there are two, one is a teacher, one is the head guy for the business stuff) even offered me a ride home today, and sugiyama sensei asked me if i was growing accustomed to japanese life as well. it was nice heh.

after dinner today i headed over to uny; *tip of the day! after 6 pm, the sushi that will go bad for the day is literally marked half off. the funny thing is that the people you see buying them are all business men/women looking for tomorrow's lunch heh. i figured i'd join them heh.

btw, at this time you can also get a full platter of sashimi/nigiri for about 3 bucks... i have yet to try super market sushi though.

so yeah... remind me i need to get a picture of a cantalope/melon w/ the price. it's freaking unbelievable.

anyways, that's it for today; don't think i did a very good job of trying to trascribe how enjoyable today was, but... ah well haha. laters.

i missed the bus today. and it`s not because i woke up late (ok well it kind of is), but i couldn`t figure out which shirt to wear :P.

yes. no comment, right?

so coming into work an hour late again... (it`s ok cause it`s summer time) i find itou sensei at his desk (directly across from me). and normally i have a bottle of water with me to take my daily vitamins (dad`s doing) - that and it saves time if i wake up late heh. moving on, i ran out of water yesterday, and decided to ask if the water in the 調理場　(kitchen) is any good...:

me: excuse me... itou sensei, is the water in the kitchen any good?
itou sensei: which kitchen?
m: the one we all use... in the staff room.
i: well you know... the water here is different. our water is special. it comes from fuji san, it is crystal clear and takes many years to roll from the top of the delicious spring on fuji san. i think it might be the best water in the world. however if you go into the parks around here... i`d be a little more cautious... but, the water here, is very おいしいです。 (delicious). so please, try some of our water.

that was by far the most thorough explanation to, i think, an incredibly simple question. itou sensei`s of the world are awesome haha.

he really just had to say `yes.` ;P.

heh, as the title refers. today is payday!! woo! 300 000 yen deposited go!

but i had no way of getting to it... or so i thought. so my supervisor took me to the bank so i could withdraw money from, what i thought was temporarily inaccessable, my bank account heh. so in usual preparations, i grab my hanko, my check book, and off we go to the bank to with draw the moneies :). and this is when she sees what i've been storing my hanko in...

the original paper envelope that i originally received it in.

this is also the time i taught her the meaning of the word 'ghetto.'

supervisor: what the hell is that? we need to get you a case! and you can cause you have the money now :)!
me: what, you don't like my paper bag?
s: hate it. haha.
m: but it's so useful, and i can roll it up and everything!
s: dame! (no good!)... it's so... it's not right...
m: oh.. you mean ghetto?

at this point the bank teller comes to me and tells me i need to fill out my w/draw slip again. a note to all of you; when w/drawing money, you can no longer write your name as first, middle, last. in japan, even if your name is in english, you must write it as last, first, middle. also, you have to put your pin number (i thought these were secret) blatantly on said form. oh, and they also require you to use your hanko (replaces your signature) to confirm everything.

so as i pull out my 'case' i start unrolling it underneath the desk and then stamp accordingly. apparently my supervisor found this hilarious.

s: haha you don't have to unroll it underneath the desk lol.
m: but you said it's ghetto.
s: what is 'g..e...t...to?'
m: oh.. um... like kabuki chou, or something really old, or something just blatantly wrong, but people still do it/ use it.
s: i still don't get it.

i write 'this is ghetto' on my hanko 'case.'

this apparently she understood haha.

so the reason i had to go through this entire ordeal to get money was because my cash card/atm card hadn't come yet. or so i thought. my supervisor takes me back to my apartment, along the way she starts asking me questions about my mailbox. we get to my apartment midway conversation when she says:

s: so yes, have you checked your mailbox lately?
m: everyday, it's the one in the door right?
s: don't you have a mail box of sorts for everyone to use?
m: ...i'm pretty sure i don't. i mean i got my bills in the mailbox in my door, why?

we start walking up the stairs (i live on the second floor). halfway up to the second floor i lose sight of her.

m: sensei?
s: .... what's this?
m: what's what?
s: come here.

there is a mail box for every apartment in the building. mine is filled with mail. <i<my bad</i> haha. anyways, upon rumaging through my mail, we find the gas bill, and of course, the post office notice that my bank cards are there at yoshiwara's main post office.

s: so that was easy enough.
m: so you know where it is?
s: nope.

she opens her cellphone.

s: moshi  moshi? bakanashitsumon ga aru (i have a stupid question.) where is yoshiwara's main post office? (she's blushing at this point).

she finishes the convseration.

s looking at me: no no i know a lot of post offices, i know the one in fuji! honest! i just wasn't... um... sure which one was yoshiwara's.. yeah...
m: ....right.
s: really!
m: uh huh.

we get to yoshiwara's main post office and we get indoors, the clerk starts walking over.

s: oh crap, you have your passport right?
m: no... you told me not to bring it?
s: mmm... photo id?
m: my driver's license (drug dealer status picture)
s: that'll have to do.

the clerk arrives and asks for my id. as i hand it to him, my supervisor starts laughing.

s: so um... that's ghe...tto... right? /pointsatmydriver'slicense.
m: haha yeah... i look like a drug dealer eh? 
s: more like drug user... haha
m: ...

lol. this is all in good fun btw haha. we start heading back to school after getting my bank cards when i remember something we studied in class, but forgot; the street signs in japanese. cause shit... when would i ever need to know these right? :\

m: so what're the sign right under the number sign? the number sign is speed right? is the sign under it 'do not go past this speed?'
s: um... which one?
m waits till we drive by another one (it has "30" above it): that one!
s: oh yeah, something like that.
m: so does that mean you should not be going past 30km/h?
s: yes it does.
m: so that's why you're going 40?
s: ... haha.. well... um...
m: yes?
s: normally drives 30! 10 over is ok!
m: so why not now?
s: .... no no no-bo-dy drives 30, it's too slow!

haha i love these antics. then when i got back to my desk, we were all sitting around when hayashi sensei comes over to me.

hayashi sensei: so we have a soccer tournament yesterday... i'd like you to go watch.
m: how can i watch if it's yesterday?

every sensei in the area laughs. 

h: (in japanesee) ah crap... now i'm just going to speak japanese from now on :P.
m: mattaku (geez), look what you did everyone! :P

everyone laughs again haha.

but the final antic for my friday at school has to go to ozawa sensei. i catch her emailing me a message, and i saw that she wrote shikkari:

m: so is that shikkari as in shikkari suru (get a grip)?
ozawa sensei: oh this? yes, yes it is.
m: really?
o: no.

haha.

this is why we never give jeff alcohol when he's hasn't eaten anything. seriously. last night was a celebratory event of sorts; as you all know, we all finally got paid heh.

except susie and i were the last two there heh. so we walked into the indian restaurant that we were all going to meet up in to try and find everyone. except nobody was there. i tried asking if any of our party members were there... when it finally hit me haha.

me: so did you see [insert anyone's name]?
host: um.. no (repeat)
m: ohhhhh have you seen a lot of gaijin (foreigners)? 
h: ohhhhhhhh yes! they just left!
m: could you tell me where they went please?
h: sure, they're at the bar on the second floor heh.

on the second floor is this quaint little bar where we found everyone; brian, doug, lawrence, sofia, lauren, and albert quietly drinking in the corner. however after a pint of guiness i needed food in my empty stomach; susie and i headed to the indian restaurant downstairs for our dinner.

this wasn't good, because i was getting um.. buzzed happy. i was laughing at everything, and it didn't help that susie was buzzed too, so we kinda just kept on laughing haha.

after eating we headed back upstairs to the bar, where i found brian striking up a cconversation with the bartender and one of the customers. they were talking about hawaii and japan and other cultural things; i felt i should join.

kakeshiwa san, the bartender, shuji san, the customer and i, brian left, started having another conversation. it got really deep too haha /blamesthealcohol. i ordered another kirin, and felt it polite to pay first (usually you pay after) incase i forgot to pay later... the bartender smiled upon this and said that it's very rare to see people more polite than japanese people heh.

we ended up talking about everything though; the difference between americans and japanese, customs, cultures, ethics, good and bad, things we're interested in, and what not. really good conversation. except it was getting late and shuji san had to go back home;

anyways, afterwards we headed for karaoke (my first btw), and all i have to say is that there's nothing quite like eight people singing at the top of their lungs greenday - when i come around, or red hot chili peppers - under the bridge till 3 am. fun times.

it's been another lazy weekend here, yesterday i spent recovering from the night before, and then afterwards just walked around the downtown area of yoshiwara - which i still believe is ghetto as all hell, but there's a strange tranquility to it, baring in mind the geisha bars and what not.

today kurebayashi sensei took me to a hobby shop b/c i needed to find a birthday present for a friend who turns 28 today heh. it's nothing fancy but i think he'll like it... if i can get a hold of him lol.

anyways.

doug came over, and we went exploring through the local jumbo encho, a kind of a um... target of sorts i think; then again everything is kind of like a target of sorts in japan - you can buy anything anywhere seriously. but after viewing these ridiculous prices, doug kept mentioning to me about the 100yen shop... and i agree entirely... i`m just a lazy bastard :P.

so to the 100yen shop we go!

again, more cleaning supplies and what not, and after a triumphant return to my apartment, i took doug to the local restaurant that i go to all the time. needless to say it was a nice conclusion to a lazy weekend.

and happy 28th birthday brian!

BODY:
another relaxed day as usual. though part of me has this feeling that it shouldn`t be this relaxed...

so a lot of things to think about coming up this week. doug and other jets are planing a scaling of mt. fuji... though i learned today from ishikawa sensei that a typhoon is coming so maybe not... so i wondered if there`s another time that we could scale it:

me: so can we scale it next week?
ishikawa sensei: oh no no no that`s not possible.
m: oh why is that?

ishikawa sensei and shida sensei think about it for awhile...

shida sensei: oh yes, it`s quite cold up there!
i: it`s always like that though!
s: oh right... well you can`t anyways because the air is too thin.
i: it`s always like that too!
s: oh right... um...
m: so what`s wrong with next week exactly?
i: well in september it`s だめ (no good)!
m: why?
i: well... um...
s: ...
i: hara sensei... why is fuji closed in september?
hara sensei: oh... well... that`s because... um...

a few seconds later...

h: ok.. i don`t know really lol.
m: ...

so yeah fun times right? and then i went to talk with sato sensei (she has the voice of a flower):

m: so have you climbed fuji san?
sato sensei: yeah, many times!
m: so why can`t you climb it in september?
s: oh... you can.. just that ぽつんぽつん people do (very few).
m: haha ぽつんぽつん? (pronounced: potsun potsun)
s: oh... is that interesting?
m: yes! haha.
s: ok thank you ^^.

what i thought it was amusing... like ぷりぷり (pron: puripuri) which means shaking... or getting angry... i forget which lol.

so there`s an atami beach party at 2 pm on sunday which sounds like fun, byob, bring your own booze :P and there are said to be fireworks that night.

tonight the fuji crew got together for brian`s birthday. it was pretty cool cause they all came to yoshiwara and i was able to take them around and, we tried other places first, but ended up going to the restaurant that`s literally been my second home.

lol and i can prove it too:

kind old host (she sings her japanese, it`s awesome): welcome!

we all sit down

h: oh you brought friends today! (in japanese)
m: ...yes.

sofia, lawrence, brian, susie, doug, lauren all look up and smile.

h: he [me] comes here everyday by himself... it`s nice to know he has friends (in japanese)!
m: translates.
so,l,su,d,l: lol
m: ...

yes... i go there that often. in fact everything they ordered that night, i`ve tried myself already lol. but as we sit down, i find that sofie, lauren, and susie are sitting to my right, in front, and left respectively:

sofia: wow aren`t you the lucky one, two beautiful women sitting next to you! /sarcasm.
m: well... n...
s: ok, no more talking out of you!
m: i was going to say <i>three</i> beautiful women ^^;
s: you`re damn right!

so yeah, brian found out that the video game machine was free... so we ended up playing that for a few minutes haha - nothing quite like me hunched over 90 degrees to play a game meant for kids ;P

(geez)...

in my never ending quest to find a cell phone, i find my self asking ozawa sensei for some help... because, well, i know absolutely nothing about cell phones in japan. things such as `happy time 2` and `21000￥ plans and you get 28750￥ worth of minutes`.... blah. so yeah, after much deliberation (i still have no idea what it means) i basically referenced that i`ll ask my supervisor.

then, knowing me, i was so confident that my supervisor used vodafone; she always talked about it being the best, and what not, and that it`s the cheapest, and i swore to freaking balls in hell she uses it!

me: i swear she uses it! i`d bet my life on it! ...or at least 100￥ that she does!
ozawa sensei: /grin ok!

she searches through her phone to find my supervisor`s cell phone email address - and it`s @docomo.

and there goes my 100￥ :P (it`s about 90 cents lol).

fcuk haha.

anyways, supervisor comes to school finally and i finally get to talk to her about the things i need to take care of: pension plan, health care, form 6166 for tax purposes, some translation things, etc...

oh and on a random note, she, ozawa sensei, shida sensei, and yamaguchi sensei are going to new york this winter break - so much thanks to my brother and two ny native cousins for helping me out with some recommendations - and i talked to her about some of the research things we`ve conspired as the chu family heh.

me: yamaguchi sensei seems to be in quite a pinch... she um... her plane tickets...
supervisor: ...hasn`t bought them yet right?
m: yeah... it`s really bad isn`t it?
s: don`t worry about it, she`ll still get there.
m: but it`s so expensive!
s: yeaop.
m: but isn't tha...
s: し。。。か。。。た。。。が。。。あ。。。り。。。ま。。。せ。。。ん！　^_~

(roughly, `there`s nothing we can do about it!`) haha.

... well what else do i post :P

anyways today was another slow day, yes there are things i can be working on, but knowing me, i think the week i have left is too much time to do such. and also knowing me, i`ll never start on anything earlier than 48 hrs before it`s due... which has taken me down a few bad experiences... but hey... i have a week right?

sooooooooo...

today at lunch, sato sensei (flower) was eating lunch alone at her desk today, and i decided to invite her to eat lunch with me; i`m not fond of eating alone, let alone watching friends eat alone when they don`t have to. and today`s antics might be hard to get because of what is lost in translation... as most of my antics are (now that i look back on them):

sato sensei: so did you hear there`s a big typhoon coming?
me: really? what`s that mean?
s: well we all might get free vacation days hehe.
m: is that why it`s been raining randomly this week?
s: um.. nope.
m: so then why is it? isn`t the rainy season june only?
s: oh, right... well you know as [another sensei`s name i forgot]sensei says it right?
m: /shakes head.
s: june is the rainy season... july in august is just ただの雨。。。。。。(simply rain).

heh.

BODY:
so finally breaking out of that procrastination slump, i spent all morning talking to my jte`s and my supervisor (who`s also a jte, japanese teacher of english) about ideas and plans, as well as writing the first lesson plan for the first week heh. /woo.

... i just need to write my self introduction now, but i at least have something down on paper right?

ha... ha?

anyways. i came to work today, and saw a spider the size of my palm run out from behind the trash can... ncuking futs!!! /shudders.

so, somewhat of an update is in order hehe. typhoon ho! it`s apparently coming, it`s apparently strong lol (or so i hear):

sup: mmmm there`s a warning on the pa system. the typhoon is coming so all the students are ordered to go home.
me: but... we still have to stay huh...?
s: yeaop.
m: sucks huh.
s: yeaop.

haha, these conversations are seriously the best. it would be the equivalent of the sarcasm in mike wu packaged neatly in an efficient japanese woman that is my supervisor haha (don`t expect any of you to get that).

on a foggy day by the bay. and i do mean foggy:

`hey jeff, we should get a picture here, it`s glorious! so what part of the cloud did you want to get in the background, i think it`s whiter here, or would you like that faint faint tint of... oh no wait, it`s white there too.` - m.w.

afterwards, i explained some ideas that i wanted feedback from my supervisor on; because she is the head of the english department, thus the supervisor. normally there are six first year classes, and they are split into two groups, so instead of 40-41 students, i have classes of 20-21 students - which is nice - but i heard that the students who aren`t in the team teaching classes have to go through a prep class of sorts.

which is boring.

even to the teachers.

but on the plus side everything seemed to go smoothly. and she seemed happy that i was actually putting thought into my job lol. well not that i don`t... 

...what?

but yeah, a typhoon is coming, and they were showing a satellite image on the news. so you have to understand this is why God hates me, this could not have gone more perfectly.

1st picture: island of japan, typhoon currently at the bottom situated around the middle of the island. 

me: oh, this is bad, i have friends in tokushima! they`ll be in the typhoon!
wakazono sensei: oh don`t worry, they`ll be ok!

2nd picture: close up of japan with the typhoon edges just off the coast of tokushima and slightly over shizuoka.

me: oh well that`s good, it won`t hit them, and we`ll be ok too right?

3rd picture: projected path. <b>right</b> through shizuoka.

me: ...
ishikawa sensei: i guess he didn`t know till now hahaha.
w: i guess not...

yes. remember those thunder storms mike? this would be like the mother of all of them eh? haha.

shit.

it's gone! huzzah! that was some night last night...

yesterday was rather hectic. around 2 pm or so kyoto sensei (vice principal) started asking the staff to go home in preparation of the strong (it was) typhoon that was heading our way. though i couldn't help but laugh when kyoto sensei, kyouno sensei, and another sensei, matsumoto sensei, had a conversation by the window as everyone started packing up to leave.

matsumoto sensei: hey it looks like rain huh.
kyounosensei: yeaop it looks like rain.
m: oh hey it looks like it's raining harder than it was before!
k: yeaop.
m: maybe we should get home soon...
k: yeaop.

needless to say this continued for some time...

in the mean time hara sensei was talking to me about the typhoon:

hara sensei: maybe we can all go home earlier... any time now kyoto sensei will tell us to go home...
me: yeah that'd be nice heh.
h: oh please tell us to go home... 

haha, the best is that he says this in english so that the vp can't understand him lol.

but yeah, so anyways, i actually went home around 4 in the afternoon that day (many thanks to ishikawa sensei) when i realized i had nothing to eat or drink during the typhoon... 

heh so i braved the typhoon to get food! /psychup!

though to be honest it was rather eerie; the rain was pouring down, wind was pretty strong, and i was the only foreigner/anyone walking around the streets with an umbrella lol. needless to say, that night was, interesting. the rain kept pouring outside and hitting my door, the wind also would rattle my windows and doors - not so much hurricane status, but so long as your windows and doors all closed you should be alright (horace you were right heh).

nothing like wow to keep you company through a typhoon heh.

...at least moral values and proper health.

bekyoukai!

or welcome party get together thing for all the private municipal jets that work in shizuoka ken. needless to say today was filled with it's own quirks and antics that left me somewhat, well, a little bit wondering what in the world exactly happend, and how it went wrong... at least the getting to shizuoka part.

so as usual, i got to the bus station looking for fuji eki, and as usual, i saw that it's leaving just as i got there.

great.

upon finally getting to fuji eki, i followed the signs simply enough for the train to shizuoka city heh. simple enough right? after paying for my ticket, i stood waiting on the platform - the train came a few minutes late - and not only that, but it turns out to be the express train (which i learn after i get on).

so the train has three cars, and the first two said 'for reserved seating only,' as well as some small kanji text underneath, and so i sprinted towards the back, thinking that that was the 'non reserved' seating (cause it was the last car on the friggin train).

train worker: um... can i see your ticket please?
me: oh yeah sure one sec. /getssaidticket.
t: oh you can't sit here... this is reserved seating (no one was there btw).
m: oh...

he starts leading me through to the other cars. see the thing i didn't quite notice was that really really small unreadable kanji text under 'reserved cars' was a small sign stating 'and some room for people who didn't reserve seating,' but yeah, go figure (note, i swore to krist he said 230 yen... nanahiyakusanjuyen vs. nihyakusanjuyen, i have no idea where my head was this morning...)

so he showed me to my seat, and says:

t; 730 yen please.
m: oh, yeah no problem.

i put 180 in his hand. yes, i'm retarded... let alone being retarded in front of this guy with two lazy eyes and hair as if he were electricuted (he was wearing a hat, which didn`t help lol).

t: this isn't 730 yen....
m: oh shit i'm sorry...

i take the 50 yen piece away and add a 100 yen piece (thus 230 yen). 

t:... um... 
m: oh yeah don't worry about it, my bad haha (ala russell peter's dad and the beer waitress).

i turn to look out the window. he taps me on the shoulder again.

t: ... you owe me 500 yen more...
m: what?
t: 730 yen, not 230 yen...
m: /realizes. oh.... (shit). sorry....

anyways, i pay the guy correctly despite that and arrive safely in shizuoka - oh yeah, being the express train, i took 20 minutes versus the usual 40 or so.

great.

but yeah, despite the confidence shattering experience, i press forward towards shizuoka. the benkyoukai was a lot of fun, random sarcasm, and apparently a lot of private jets can do these weird phsyical feats!

al and another girl can jiggle their eyes.
me and my arms.
christy (i think that`s her name) can pull her thumb all the way to her wrist... and a number of other weird things...
mark can independently move his eyes.
amy can make three loops with her tongue...

a bunch of freaks we are...

and yes that was more memorable than anything we did that day lol; this was meant to be an introduction thing of sorts - and i can remember maybe 5 / 40 jets that were actually there heh.

afterwards was pretty cool. blair (3rd year, there`s two of them btw, and their both private jets, and this will get confusing later on) took me and amy to a beer garden. now these beer gardens are pretty nifty (pictures of course); they are on the rooftops of shizuoka, with a live band and most japanese beers on tap - yabisu is like guiness for future reference.

we met up with douglas and annie (also 3rd year and private jets) there and needless to say a good time was had by all. except for our waitress... (picture of course) who was kind of cute, but i realized the uncomfortable expression on her face haha; blair had his arm around her.

good times.

but yeah, after heading back i actually arrived in fuji city an hour before my bus was to come - so with time to kill i decided to check out that bar we went to a week ago to celebrate our paychecks heh. (and i have pictures this time!)

needless to say i met kawashima san (bartender) and two new people - aoi san, and ue san - who knows shuji san), and shuji san who came a bit later heh. good times; might go fishing with them sometime.

... i didn`t want to play wow in japan; though i`ll have to admit, it`s rekindled my enjoyment of the game - let alone i spent six hrs this morning playing. and i played last night from 10pm or so till 4 am...

but the main purpose was simply to fill the dead time between when the town shuts down around 8 pm and when i go to sleep.

i just never really considered weekends lol.

moving on... two things i think you kinda have to know; linda is playing ffvii again and we`ve been talking about it a lot, and i mean a lot haha - i always give her crap about only using tifa and cloud... sooo:

chen san: oh yea, tifa, yuffie, red, and cait have their final limit breaks
me: oooo, grats :D
c: thanks
c: cloud, barret, and vincent are level 3
c: and cid is umm....
/~5 seconds later or so
c: ...i'm working on cid
m: lol
c: lol thanks

haha, seriously, keep at it linda ; ) - that was just great lol.

the second thing is that horace lived in the hk before he came back to america to study at SD, and he`s faced his share of hurricanes lol:

and here you go horace, i was writing it down lol:

horace: how's the typhoon treating you?
me: lol, played wow all night, went to bed, that was it
h: haha, is it still around?
m: nope, one day
m: that was it lol
h: bleh weak
h: i remember one of the hurricanes in hk circled back around for a second pass at us
h: hahahaha
m: LOL
h: it was awesome though, we were out of school for like a week
m: it's all {fcuk you horace!}
m: lol
h: i think like three for the typhoon itself, and then like another two for cleanup, it was a MESS though
h: branches everywhere, windows blown out...
h: seriously straight out of a disaster movie
h: haha
h: driving to school was like playing "dodge all the random shit strewn all over the road"
m: lol, fun stuff
h: yes, this is good stuff man, you should write it down
m: hahaha
m: yes
m: i.. am... believe me
h: haha
h: good, good
m: yes...
h: hahaha

but anyways, john and lauren came by, and we hit up 100yen store as well as kappa sushi heh, and on the way back was the absolute randomest thing i think i`ve ever heard...

we were walking back from kappa as we pass through chuou eki, and right as we walk pass this harmless old lady, i hear over my shoulder...

`baka gaijin!` (damn foreigners!)

LOL, hahaha you have to imagine it in the frailest voice you`ve ever heard... with the utmost intention and ill will.

anyways haha. for a good time, go look up who the head of the world anti-doping agency is. enjoy. c/o horace again.

... let`s just say blair`s funny as hell when he`s drunk off his ass. the story behind this is that he was so gone, that he introduced amy to the same person... twice... and this was his excuse for doing so.

anyways.

today was the trip to atami for the beach party and fireworks festival! as well as other random antics - including this one japanese woman who literally got on the bus at chuou eki, and got off one stop later. it literally cost her about 150 yen to spare her from a minute or two of walking... 

`wow, that was just like an american!` - john

hahahahahaha. but yeah, today was our trip to the beach with fellow jets on the izu penninsula in shizuoka! and let`s just say that, for a resort town, the beach was maybe the size of a football field... and with everyone in the stadium lying down on the field... not the most spacious of beaches.

on the plus side, it was easy as hell to find all of the jets who were there; just find the patch of white in a sea of yellow haha.

on a random note, i highly highly highly recommend <u>against</u> swimming at the beaches of japan - unless you know where to go, and atami was not a place to go.

it was actually a lot of fun. i ran into brad (3rd year who i met at the first enkai) who brought a frisbee and we got some ultimate going.

it was the non-asians; kiren, mark (aussie who has been teaching all around the south east pacific area with his wife, not with jet), joe, scott, and john.

vs.

the asians... and blair (not shiz blair, another blair who works in hama, and it`s his first year, 3rd year blair is the one who i met in shiz on friday). the asians would be me, brad, blair (3rd year happa), blair (1st year, from new zealand), and a japanese nurse heh.

nothing quite like ulty... with beer rules lol. so <i>normally</i> you get about 3 steps or so after you catch the frisbee to stop yourself. you get one (not much room), in addition, if you`re holding your beer, we give you an extra step haha.

i am not joking. we played the first half with beers lol.

afterwards we played some three flys up with kieran (who throws rugby status, hard and straight), mark, and brad and me heh - the girls smoking cigarettes (japanese) were talking about us :p we`re hawties lol.

anyways, on a completely random note. brad plays wow. not only does he play wow, but he`s within the same lvl range as i am, and not only that, he plays <b>on</b> cenarius! do you have any idea how rare this is? all wow players are aware of how annoying it is that everyone you meet who plays wow is never, ever, on the server that you play on. ever.

this is the equivalent of winning the lottery, while finding a four leafed clover, on your trek to el dorado.

on a random note, MORE brit slang! bullocks! bullocks means, well, shit lol. i.e. aaaa bullocks! or you can say `that`s the bullocks!` (the shit), or the equivalent, dog bullocks!

but the true reason why atami was great that night. fireworks. now i have to say, normally i`m the kind of person who could care less about fireworks. but wow. (i have pictures <i>and</i> videos!). this was possibly the best fireworks display i`ve ever seen. it`s kinda nifty too, i nean japanese people.

everyone was clapping at the end of it lol.

and all was good that night. i finally got to have my third meal of the day at the usual hour... after midnight heh. susie and i went to denny`s afterwards (properly, and not for an actual meal - cause who goes to denny`s to eat breakfast, lunch, or dinner... who isn`t ghetto :P). but yeah, today was a blast (/nopunorcheeseintended).

so anyways, the last few days have been rather uneventful - in case you couldn`t tell - and this is all because everybody and their mom decided to use their paid time off this week just before school starts. normally i enjoy coming to work because i can have some decent conversations with the teachers here, or even work on lesson plans together. but for the most part i`m just filling empty space so to speak.

last night a bunch of jets from gotemba and nishima came down for some enkai (where the main purpose is to drink a lot) action where i also learned of sofie`s hidden hobby.

she takes pictures of people when they least suspect it.

like the one of me when i was drunk off me gorde.

fan - freaking - tastic.

my `free` internet has copped out... the network doesn`t even register on my airport, so that means one of three things.

1. the guy is out of town, and just decided to unplug the router because he doesn`t need and hopefully will plug it back in within a short amount of time...

2. the guy is connecting directly to the modem - thus no router.

3. i need to get off my cheap and lazy ass and get my own broadband and stop leeching off decent people.

i`m hoping for number one here guys. /cheer.

it`s depressing when you walk into school, and only to learn that everyone has taken their paid time off again. i wonder if it`s kind of the quiet before the storm sort of situation really. and you`d assume that this would be a great time for me to get some work done you know? more lesson plans, work on my self introduction both in front of the school, and in class... but no no... not me. i just sat around and do what i do best.

absolutely nothing.

but kurebayashi sensei came to me today, and to be all honest i haven`t seen her in awhile. she offered to help me go bike hunting, and, well, there`s something you need to know.

japan has no love for the tall.

and i don`t even think i`m that tall. my size for their bike (well at least the closest anyways) is 28in... it`s not even funny the difference you can find at bargain stores. for example; 26-27 sized bikes sell literally a dime a dozen (about 8000yen for a new one), when you look at the average 28in bike, it jumps to about 20000+.

you. bastards.

on a nice note, kurebayashi sensei took me to this nice tempura shop nearby that is really traditional heh, i`ll take you all if/when you guys get the chance to come down to japan. and of course next door is a great foreigner`s bar.

sooo, since my internet went kaputz on monday morning, i`ve actually been doing a little research on the internet to find a provider for my area. and you need to know that internet in japan is absolutely amazing. i think the fastest you can get in the us, is about 25Mbps down at about a pricetag of say... 60 dollars a month.

japan is twice that, and half the price. how freaking amazing is that?

but yes, i have no idea what to do with so much freaking bandwidth. thank you horace:

me: damn... what the hell would i do with so much fcuking bandwidth?
horace: haha
m: i mean seriously
h: ummmm
m: wtf would i do?
m: it`s just so fcuking much!!!
h: porn? ALL THE PORN YOU COULD EVER WANT TO DL
m: LOL
m: you`re so getting quoted LOL
h: MY GOD IT"S LIKE A FIREHOSE OF PORN
h: LOL
h: TOO MUCH TOO MUCH MAKE IT STOP
h: lolz

and then there`s the `other` conversations i have with horace lol:

horace: 0..........00000000000000000000000000
h: ummm that was my cat
m: LOL
h: jeff ur a fag
h: yeah that was my cat too
m: LOL
m: horace your`re gay
m: that was every japanese teacher who can`t read/type english
m: sorry
m: purely coincidence i swear
h: hahah
h: srsly
h: the keys are like right next to each other
m: lol
m: they just mashed the keyboard
m: no joke man
h: hhaahh
h: gah
h: i'm having to type OVER my cat
h: damn fuzzy animals
h: AHH
h: KITTY NO
h: NO SWIPING AT MY BOOB
m: LOL
m: oscar > pepsi

25Mbps @ $60 a month?! Plz tell me how and where I can get an awesome deal like that in the US thx.

I don't think I've ever seen anything as fast as 25M down over here. I know Comcast maxes out at 6M, and Yahoo/SBC is 3M or so (most people have 1.5M though). Boo-urns.

Regardless, if you don't get that 50M line, I'm personally flying over to Japan to kick your ass.

today was the opening ceremony for yoshiwara commercial highschool. /cheer. unfortunately this meant one thing.

i had to wear a suit again in this weather.

and of course, as i get to the bus station for my <i>first</i> day of work, it drives off right as i'm about to hop on lol. so i get to work about 20 seconds late - right as i'm at the top of the stairs i hear the bell ring, and slink into the staff office to find something utterly surprising.

it was filled with teachers.

anyways, the day continued on with the next item on the agenda, earthquake safety. now this is really well organized, all of the staff members have helmets in this room next to the staff room and everything. and everyone files outside, orderly, and calmly and gather together in their homerooms.

and that's when i noticed something odd.

well, besides all of the students staring at me and saying things such as `wow, tall...`

nor was it the hundreds of giggling school girls and (sadly) boys who would run up to me, plant their hand on how far they came up to my arms, and run away giggling.

me: fukunana sensei, something's not right...
fukunana sensei: oh? what's not?
m: why do only teachers get helmets and students get nothing? aren't the minds of the future more important?
f: ah... yes... but... you know... there's not enough room in the budget ^^.
m: oh... that's too bad huh...?
f: not really, because i have a helmet : ).

i guess i can't really say anything against that, though it feels wrong somehow...

the day progressed well enough. i gave my introduction in front of 800+ students, attended my first meeting - of of which i cannot recall nor remember a thing of, and finally a somewhat encouraging conversation with my supervisor and yamaguchi sensei:

me: ok, so our school has the lowest marks in the city of fuji. our students hate english, and don't care much for it, but that's ok!! why? because we're all new, we will raise the bar little by little so we will not be first, but we will not be last either!
yamaguchi sensei: wow! that's very ambitious of you!
m: /nod nod! we are the ambitious team! failure is not an option!
supervisor: can i give up now? i can start the give up team!

hmm... we'll work on that lol.

anyways, <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/columns/story?columnist=bucher_ric&id=2110480">here's</a> a good read i think.

so there's something you all have to know. there is one sensei here that has the absolute coolest name you will ever hear. his name /drumroll...

is clutch sensei.

that's right.

clutch.

/swish.

i think mike wu put it best lol:

me: btw, best sensei`s name ever...
m: clutch sensei
m: that name just resonates with `i`m better than you` lol
m: shit
m: he`s CLUTCH sensei!
l0stry0ga: hahaha
l: "you are...clutch sensei?"
l: "yeaop"
l: "you're clutch?"
l: "yeaop"
l: "clutch sensei?"
l: "in every sense of the word biatch"
m: LOL
m: he needs to pull out a boom box and playsthe sound of a swish LOL
l: hahahaha

other than that, today was fairly normal heh. tokita sensei (aka supervisor) took me to the cafeteria today where i discovered one of the greatest things ever heh. so for every dish you can order at the cafeteria, there are different sizes. there's small, regular, large...

and then there's 特大 (tokudai). special LARGE! /woo!

special double sized big bowl for mees! soooooooo good! and it's quite possibly the greatest deal here in japan you will ever find. that, and our cafeteria has really good food heh - even the obentos for lunch that are delivered to the staff room heh.

and also, for future reference, the word `sucks` is a great word. especially when people who learn it for the first time learn how to use it somewhat properly...:

me: so tokita sensei, i'd like to be able to talk with every english teacher after class... you know, get some feedback and learn figure out what works and what doesn't work and maybe we can work harder.
tokita sensei: oh yeah, that's a good idea! then we [the jte's] can tell you what we thought of the lesson!
m: excatly! we can say how it was a great lesson, or the best, or if it [she interrupts me]...
t: sucks!!

haha yeah... this is going to be fun.

japanese style! and it makes absolutely no sense.

today was my first day of volleyball with a group of... well i don't know how they all know each other. but for the most part, it's a bunch of engineers, and teachers, and the owner of a bakery. and these people are hardcore; they've been doing this for at least 15 years.

so let's explain some of the rules heh.

1. there is only one game, it lasts for as long as we're allowed to play.
2. if the service hits the net or hits it out of bounds, it is not a side out. it is returned to the sever who gets to try again. and again. and again. and again.
3. points are apparently awarded on side outs.
4. when a player scores a point, or successfully prevents the other team from scoring, everyone in the team, must take a ten minute break to high five said teammate at least once.
5. if the ball is every thought to be clearly out of bounds, dead, or out of play, it in fact, is not. the only requirement is you need to yell 'CHANCE!'

this is forever a weekly event for me lol.

today was a relatively easy saturday morning. today was the day that we [a few jets from shiz] are going to head up to fujimidaidanchi to grab some bbq, american style. well as american as one can get in japan.

but before we headed off, i was able to take care of a few things around the apartment. like cleaning. you know, the one i've put off for the last freaking month >.>.

but yeah, i finally got a bike! brand new! i ended up getting the one that was 15,800 yen, and paid 500 more so if in the event it were lost... it would be possibly found by the police. possibly. the funny thing is that when people in japan steal bikes, it's not even to sell or strip bare or anything. it's just to use it as a bike lol.

but yeah, a trip to midaidanchi! it was pretty fun, good food, good times, lots of jets, and lots of beer... john actually bought a grill of sorts and, well i can't remember much that night lol, but fun times! the only thing i can really remember is that mark, one of the aussies who is teaching on his own, and not affiliated with jet, got the biggest kick out of general tao's chicken...

i had no comment lol.

but the coolest thing was that they, him and his wife michelle, play video games. a lot. together. and she apparently owns in battlefield.

GO happily married couples!

so... we all ended up passing out at johns place last night... and, woke up to the most disgusting mess. ever. figure we might as well get partying all out of the way before we start teaching tomorrow right? haha!

after helping john clean up, lawrence, sofia, susie, and i headed back home to yoshiwara (lawrence and sofia are from fujinomiya). and we ate at dennys... again... for the third time. まったく. (geez). well still good times.

the rest of the day was a real lazy sunday. after lawrence and sofia left, susie and i headed off to do some proper shopping at the 100 yen shop. but yeah, there is this bench at seiyu that we loiter on. everyday. for hours haha.

it's really nice actually, it reminds me of when mark and i used to sit on library walk at times to watch life go by, and just have really good conversations. the only difference these days is that it's with susie, in japan, and, at times there's a 焼き鳥 (fried chicken) vendor, and there's an ice cream vending machine next to it lol.

seriously, one of the nicest areas in fuji lol. well convenient at least.

and though we weren't quite hungry, and we knew we needed to eat something before the town shuts down... there was only one answer heh.

kappa sushi. 100 yen per plate, how freaking great is that?

and of course afterwards we went to just hang out at the bench again. this is <i>the</i> bench lol. i mean we have seriously been sitting here each night for the last two weeks contemplating anything and everything - even whether or not we should play on the playground lol (we did btw).

but yeah, seriously having tons of fun here in japan, i wish you were all here heh.

let's get one thing straight. i've never taught a class in my life. and as much as i wish that wasn't so, it was rather evident in my first class with sato sensei; completely unorganized, scatter brained, and zero participation.

seriously one of the scariest moments ever.

but none-the-less, 頑張って！(keep trying!), just have to keep picking yourself up, and try something new, and keep going till you find something that works! /cheese.

on the plus side though, my last two classes went really well - though i think anything would have been an improvement to that first lesson heh - and turned out to actually be a lot of fun. as obvious as this sounds, it really makes a difference if you get the kids to participate heh.

but anyways, on a lighter note, at lunch today, i think i had the most pointless conversation with sato (art, not english teacher):

me: so what'd you do this weekend sato sensei?
sato sensei: oh, i went to shizuoka on a business trip.
m: oh really? what was the purpose of it?
s: it was a business trip^^/.
m: ...

o.Oa

and finally, an update on wow antics! does everyone remember peer pressure GO!?

anjira: mm, btw, i'm back ingame
Auto response from me: third class for the day.
a: good luck with classes :]
a: (that 2nd line was supposed to come before the first)

peer pressure: 1. angela: 0.

(haha jk, it's good to have you back:D)

c/o evan heh.

no better way to start your day, then with more antics... each morning we receive fliers and notices on our desks from all the teachers and organizations that the school is involved in. and as i was reading this one... there was one kanji i seriously could not figure out:

me: so itou sensei... can you please teach me how to read this kanji please? /points.
itou sensei: oh yes.
m: yes?
i: that is kanji.
m: oh yes, i know it's kanji, can you please teach me how to read it?
i: kanji.
m: kan...OHHHHHHHH /slapme

yeah...

i had four classes today. it started with my business conversation class, where goto sensei, itou sensei, ishikawa sensei, shida sensei, and wakazono sensei just wanted to hear and practice english. and to be honest, it was tons of fun, really informal and what not because they treated me as they would treat their sensei... well sort of.

my second class was the first class of students was a little troubling though. there's this one student, who really has a lot of energy, and to be honest i can't quite think of how to help him use that energy in a more constructive way - open to suggestions. he's actually fairly good in english, but irked me a little bit cause he wouldn't shut the hell up.

third class of the day was right before lunch; and to be honest, really hard to focus when you're hungry heh. the fourth class was a lot of fun as well, even though it was right after lunch... but still fun.

for the most part i get the biggest swing in classes. sometimes when i ask for volunteers, i get nobody. zero. zip. nada. zilch. and sometimes i get the whole class. and those, those are just what can put the biggest smile on your face.

it's really surprising to see what students these days find really cool. lately, from what i can surmise this is what is `in` with the students these days:

1. big hair (usually a different color than their natural)
2. mullets
3. big belts
4. the `i'm a badass and i'm too cool for schoo` look
5. random english words inserted in random sentences. of course their usage of the word is completely wrong too lol.

but for the most part, i was 3/4 today, and am rather glad that the majority of my classes turned out rather well so far - and in 7 classes, i only have one really energetic student (still open to suggestions on how to deal with heh, personally i think that negative anything just isn't the right way to do it... but yeah).

なんとかなるさ！

it worries me somewhat when my friends nohere near japan know more about the news in japan than i do. then again it's not as if i watch tv, nor have access to the internet anymore /wavesgoodbyetothefreemonth...

but i think mike put it best really; but i think i'll leave it out. let's just say it involves um... well let's not even say that. but the jist of today's topic is that there is a HUGE typhoon in kyushu right now, and apparently headed this way. typhoon two! go!

but yes, today my supervisor struck up a rather interesting conversation with me:

tokita sensei: so jeff, do you like tv?
me: not so much anymore, i used to watch tons as a kid.
t: oh really? how come you don't watch much tv any more?
m: because they're all reality shows that show whiny stuck up people.
t: whiny?
m: yes, /searchesforitinthedictionary.
t: ohhhh, /writes it down.
m: what are you doing?
t: it's my word of the day! so far i have: whiny, sucks, and ghetto!
m: ...

not your typical word of the day calenders from what i can remember, but yeah.

today i had only one class, and it was the most fun i've had in a class, ever. i tried something new; if the kids are going to be loud, then i'm going to be louder!

and it worked.

i had everyone paying attention, everyone participating, it was so awesome. like a well greased machine, fifty minutes passed by like no other heh. it's great when they can pick up on your little jokes in english. for example, the phrase `so so` heh.

i don't think i can quite explain it, but it was hilarious to have them answer me all the time with `so so.`

q: do you understand?
a: so so.
q: do you know the answer?
a: so so.
q: do you like this idea?
a: so so.

ok i know, it sounds annoying a bit heh. but when they're laughing, and having a good time, even if it's at my expense, it's a wonderful thing i think - and infinately better than silence. infinately.

and holy shit, it's happening a lot more frequently.

horace: are you that chummy with the kids already though?
me: lol
m: no
m: <u>i just me them all once heh</u>
h: what?
h: english, not engrish
m: LOL
m: i just MET them only ONCE
m: shit
m: that was bad lol
h: hahah
m: at first i thought `the fcuk he talkin about?`
m: then i re-read it...
h: hahaha
h: srsly

just remember: you all have <b>no</b> comment! ever.

another four classes today, and as surprising as it is, these are really draining. i mean i seriously use up almost all of my energy per class just to keep the momentum going; i've even started eating breakfast these days!

but for the most part, class was good today except for one class. there is this one girl, who seriously could control the entire class. and there's just one shitty thing about it.

she pms'd (don't mean this to be offensive to the members of the opposite sex, but i literally mean it, her mood changed so quickly it wasn't even funny) so badly on me mid class.

at first it was really good because she was active and talking and raising her hand, and then all of a sudden she clammed up and made the rest of class the longest 30 mintues i've ever experienced.

on the plus side though, the other three classes i had worked like clockwork heh. everyone was participating, everyone was talking, and after i broke the silence with some humility on my own part, everything just clicked. to be honest i'm having a lot of fun teaching, regardless of those two students i have.

tonight susie and i decided to be adventurous; instead of taking the bus to fujimidaidanchi, we thought we'd bust out some bikage! i mean yeah it was all up hill, yeah it was far as hell, but shit, why not?

it took us an hour of biking/walking our bikes.

and nothing to make you feel out of shape, when you watch jr. high girls bike up it, while having a conversation, while admiring the scenery, while laughing at me and susie who are sweating our asses off lol.

but yeah, so we met up with john and, without meaning to, invited a jte who lives right under john heh. now the interesting thing, is that this jte, tsuzuki mayumi sensei, not only has the same first name as my supervisor, but my supervisor <i>taught</i> her when she was in highschool... 11 years ago! holy shit haha.

but yeah, we found this really good okonomiyake shop in fujimidaidanchi, and the best part is you get to make it yourself, and it's like tebanyaki (the setup i mean). very cool.

finally, to get an idea of what this hill was like, the way back down was the easiest thing in the world.

it took us no more than 10 minutes to get home.

i'm going to hell.

one way ticket, with a layover in chicago... well at least my supervisor is going with me. she's got a first class seat^^.

so 'why?' you might ask.

where to begin. friday's are relatively relaxing for me. one class, after lunch, and that's it for my week - not that i'm complaining or anything - and as much fun as it is to just sit around my desk listening to music and chatting on aim, i made the biggest mistake of my life.

i told my supervisor that i was bored, and wanted to go to one of her (or anyother teacher's) class. and that's when she made the biggest mistake of her life.

she invited me to her 3rd period class...

now this class started off as any other class really. simple introduction, some quirks about the english language (it was a writing class), and then the class hit an idling point:

supervisor: so... how about you teach us some bad words!
me: su...wait what? are you sure? /halo /angelssinging /big beam of light
s: of course!
m: but um... in english? i mean... are you serious?

i <i>thought</i> she was joking.

s: yeah! don't you [the seven students in that class] want to learn bad words in english?
all seven students, especially the two guys: YEAH!
m: um... ok

...

i learned <b><u>everything</b></u>. they learned <b><u>everything</b></u>. 

`cultural exchange` so to speak... right? nothing quite beats my supervisor saying:

s: ok, repeat after me. `you bastards.`
all seven students: you... bastards.
s: GOOD! now try 'shit!'
a: s..hi..to..

<i>oh that's right, she said that.</i>

and that wasn't the cream of the crop either. oh no. it keeps going. as class ended, i thought it would be fun to follow standard japanese class routines.

me: 起立！礼！(kiritsu, rei!)
everyone: /standsandbows
sup: yeah, thank you... you bastards.

You're supposed to teach them bad words and the best you can come up with is "bastard" and "shit". Hey Jeff, you need some help with your choice of english bad words.

neat little phrase i learned from susie last night. btw, to get `pissed` in the u.k. is to get drunk off your ass. just fyi heh.

piss
off
early!
tomorrow's
saturday!

today was a rather normal day for me, only one class... minus the previous post lol. some more random antics from elly:

me: you're so confused!
elly: how am i confused?
e: eh?
e: i don't get it
e: i have no idea what u mean
m: you're so getting quoted elly XD
e: huH?

lol how are you not confused haha.

an interesting thought is that lately everyone is impressed i can use chop sticks like japanese people. um. hello? chinese! shoot. also something you all need to know about is this little friendly inside joke between itou sensei and suzuki sensei. i'm sure i've mentioned it before, but basically the joke is that they get the biggest kick out of trying to convince me which one is the more dangerous person. /shrug.

but everything seems to spawn from these random happenings in school. for instance, today i asked to bandage up my thumb because i pulled it back last week at volley ball, and i wanted to go play tonight. itou sensei comes over, and looks at my hand:

itou sensei: shit... what happened? you used chopsticks too much didn't you?
me: um...
i: maybe you should use a spoon, might be safer
m (playing along): no no, a spoon might actually kill me you know?
i: hahahaha
m: i rather enjoy living you know :P.
i: no spoons for you, please becareful when you use chopsticks!

hahaha. ok i'm sure it makes no sense to any of you, but i can sure you itou sensei is one of the funniest guys i know. and it jus so happens that suzuki sensei walks by and says hi, and as he walks away, itou sensei says the absoulte most randomest thing to me:

itou sensei: you know... (this is in english btw) suzuki sensei is...
me: /huh
i: gay.

hahahahahahahahahaha! gad that is so great. nothing beats people who don't speak english using english slang haha... except when i'm teaching it to them. good times good times!

the sad thing is that it seriously seems that i'm the only one enjoying myself at work and outside of work heh.

not that i'm complaining of course ^^.

for some reason, whenever i see clutch sensei, i have the urge to flex, or do some tough guy pose... `maybe i left my things...over...theeeeere!`/flex.

i wonder if he's getting annoyed by it heh.

so i feel somewhat of a recap is in order, well more of a means of catching you all up on the last six weeks or so.

i'm having a blast. the only things that are kinda nitty gritty are: the condition my apt was left in, not much food for lots of money, and no good mexican food ; ;, but other then that, work is fun, teachers are great, the jets nearby are spiffy (though no single attractive asian jet(s) nearby; ;),and my students are all, well, genki heh. currently i'm in the progress of coaching a student with hara sensei for a speech contest, teaching 12 classes and 1 business teachers english class, and the [never-ending] continuation of settling in heh.

life is good; though i do think about college days a lot lately, and it makes me want to go to grad school. ok, sorta makes me want to go to grad school.

hmmm, so i can't remember if i've mentioned it, but my supervisor has taken to [my] random english words of the day; basically whatever random english i use that she can't understand.

unfortunately these are all words that i use habitually and, unfortunately, they're all somewhat bad/informal/weird words.

so here's the list:

1. sucks
2. ghetto
3. whiny
4. hermit

i'm rather curious to see where this goes.

random shameless plug! <a href="http://www.square-enix.com">advent children</a> came out today, and within a few mere hours of dropping, it's been subbed, and released online.

is nothing sacred anymore?

so call it boredom, or whatever really, but i thought it would be funny/interesting to get a japanese name; i'm a little tired of seeing my name the only name in katakana on the roll sheet. not that any of this matters of course, except for the fact that, well i'm bored and i was curious to see what the teachers here could come up with heh.

so first, i need a family name. mine is currently `chu` with the kanji of 朱. however this is pronounced `shu.`

iwanashi sensei suggested `hiroshi` (which i kinda like actually).
my supervisor suggested `taro.`
kurebayashi sensei suggested `jun.`
chouno sensei suggested `naka` (because it is written with the kanji of 中 which is pronounced; chu).

so, so far i think the winner is shu hiroshi, or maybe shu hiro for short. /random. haha.

/shrug.

... i know i've mentioned this before, but it really doesn't make any sense to me.

why are the english department's meetings all in japanese?

right?

.
.
.

right?

.
.
.

right?

anyways wednesdays are always my favorite; i have one class, they are amazing and they're not the smart class either, but i think they should be, and i get to get my 特大 because i only have one class heh. but life in yoshiwara commercial high school is going well; the, students have atheletics testing so we're on a special schedule, students have even started to recognize me outside of school and have come over just to say `hi,` which is really nice heh.

oh and something else that makes me wonder heh. the english club doesn't like to speak english (doesn't like/can't lol) even though 4 of the members are in my classes... bastards.

on other celebratory news; fukunana sensei is taking the next month and a half off because she's expected to give birth in november!! /cheer! everyone at the office, as well as myself wish her the best of luck, and look forward to her return in late november/december-ish!

oh and grats to mike on the promotion heh. it even has a number in it; game developer 2 (vs. 1)!

what... no really, i'm not going to let this girl think she can control the class with her moodswings.

what?

you can win them over with humility and exaggerations! but yeah, today was supposed to be one of my longer days, four classes, but the 一年生(first year students) have sports testing today heh; so my last two classes are cancelled for today.

/cheer.

nothing much happening in the land of the rising sun, though i have new names from some of the teachers:

sato sensei (art teacher) suggested: jutaro.
takakubo sensei suggested: chuu.
i figured my name means 及麟 - which means 'kirin' literally... like the beer... so i suggested the name: 生ビール lol. (little joke for you japanese speakers out there).

also i was seriously amazed. as all of you know i've been cleaning my apartment gradually over the last month or so (mainly because garbage pick up is really different than the us... and i'm lazy). but yesterday was the `objects that are too big for burning or what not` day and i threw out about half of my damn apartment that night heh.

the thing that kills me is i threw it out at 7pm or so last night. and in less than an hour (i wanted to show susie how much crap i threw out) someone took half the shit i threw out... >.> hahahaha.

so though i know i'm not writing this entry on the day of (saturday) i'm still going to post it as if it were saturday heh.

but yeah, after a fairly long week of my first lessons, a much deserved (well at least it felt that way) three day weekend was upon us. why? well i really don't care why. i was more excited about the fact that this three day weekend was the weekend where i would go to kakegawa and attend the children's festival. but the best part was that i would be able to live with a host family, fukami, for two days XD. /innocentthoughts.

i think pictures speak a lot better than any words that i can ever come up with, so i promise i'll have ALL of my pictures uploaded by the end of this week, but for now i'll just indulge on random antics that i can remember heh.

after a lunch party greeting, we traveled to an お寺(temple) where we were to experience 座禅 (zen training). and just to let you all know. my host mom listens to rap music. american rap music. where they use the `n` word.

yeah.

and then she asked me to translate/explain what it means.

no thanks.

so a few things you need to learn about zen training.

1. you are to sit on a futon facing another person.
2. your eyes must be half closed, and though your face is facing the other person, you will be staring at the floor ~1m ahead of you (this is the toughest part, especially if you're tired).
3. your posture must be perfectly straight.
4. you must sit indian style with your left leg under your right thigh, and your right leg resting on your left thigh.
5. you must hold your hands in a bowl shape with your thumbs touching, but without any excess force.
6. breathe only through your nose, and focus on only the inner being of yourself.

and you must hold this for 60 minutes.

oh, and no noises. none. zip. zilch. nada. zero. you get the point.

zen master: so if you fall asleep, you will be hit. hard. with this. /whipsoutawoodenstick.

this is no ordinary stick either. it is about 1m long, and a little smaller than a 2x4, and it has a flat surface on the end. and then he proceeds to abuse a pillow. and this would be if the pillow happened to scratch your brand new car, in addition leaving corrosive substances on it and then laughing and giving you the finger kind of abusive hit that you would give it. yeah. that hard.

zen master: oh wait... this is the CHILDEN'S stick. this is your stick.
everyone: ...

now <i>this</i> stick, is about 1.5m bigger than a 2x4 and, also, flat ended on the end. this, this is the adult stick... so if you get hit, he whaps you rather hard on the shoulder blades, two for each.

so... how to avoid the stick:

1. don't fall asleep (he hits you where your neck and shoulder meet)
2. keep your back straight
3. don't make a noise
4. optional; he will walk around the area, if you bow to him, he will whap you. this is to keep the mind focused and disciplined - you can see big athlete types cringe as they are about to get hit.

yeah... fear the monk.

john's host family came over today for a bbq that my host family was holding. it was a real chill time, i mean we all had good food and drinks and everyone was just having a good time.

afterwards we all headed towards a semi-real tea ceremony. for the most part it's just getting to eat a nice pastry and a cup of super concentrated green tea heh.

now maybe it's just me, but there was this one girl who was wearing a tube top (blonde of course :P). now i'm not one to say what the dress attire for tea ceremonies is, but i'm <i>pretty</i> sure you shouldn't wear something like that. just, you know, somewhat postitive.

all in all it was a lot of fun. after some heartfelt goodbyes and exchanges of contact information, we all had to return back from which we came. and after nearly three hours of sitting in public transportation with no music, i'm finally home :).

damn i'm tired.

trying a new method of teaching; being prepared (ok ok, well moreso!)lol.

it's a special week today, three days of teaching, and another three day weekend at the end heh - though for some reason i'm feeling incredibly tired and i can't seem to get enough sleep these nights (avg. 7 hrs or so).

so anyways, a few revolations i've had these days:

i want to get more involved in this school. no more sitting at my desk and chatting to you guys (not that that's bad or anything), but i want to try and get to know my students heh.

kendo club, HO!

well that's what kendo sounds like haha. pretty entertaining to see the least, but i don't quite understand. also eight of my students are in kendo, so they were really glad to see that i went to check them out heh.

also the judo team practices right next to the kendo club, and three of my students are in the judo club:

yuuta (student 1): hello jeff teacher.
me: um... hello yuuta, please don't call me `jeff teacher.`
y: ok... /thinks... ok mr. jeff :)
m: better... i guess.
morito (student 2): jeff sensei! we ran into each other at the bookstore, remember? 
m: yes, /salute! (i asked my students to create team names, his group's name is captain morito, so i call him, well, captain morito lol).
y: btw mr. jeff, don't learn kendo, learn judo!
mo: yes, judo is much better! what would kendo do without their sticks?
y: /mimickingkendo look at how ridiculous this is!
mo: /nod nod
m: ...

yes, rivalrys lol.

anyways just got back from japanese class in fujinomiya - which for the most part wasn't so bad, not quite like 伊藤 and 西村 sensei's but still good practice for the most part. it'd be nice if my kanji ability was up to speed though - 練習練習 right sensei?

anyways, this week i've just prepared a lot of games for my students and what not. i checked out the kendo club and judo club again and hope to soon be able to participate with my students; i'm starting to think it's easier to practice judo since kendo requires the clothes, armor, and weapon that are really expensive (about 300dollars+).

really tired today, will post again tomorrow heh.

well, we did it! we won over pms girl and she's back to her old participating self! /cheer! what did it you ask?

hangman did it.

at lunch today sato sensei came up to me:

me: good afternoon sato sensei!
sato sensei: good afternoon!
m: /eatinghistokudairice XD.
s: oh, did you know another typhoon is coming!?
m: ...
s: please look forward to it!
m: ...
s: ^^.

i guess i will... anyways, a nice day of four classes today and as usual i went to check out kendo and judo again after class. i know most people kind of say this, but it's a lot harder than it looks.

you always have to step right foot first. needless to say, when you step you don't really step, but slide your feet across right foot first, and then left foot following. i practiced this for at least 30 minutes straight.

needless to say the judo club got the biggest kick out of it.

i spent a good two hours or so just on my hands and needs cleaning my bathroom... yeah it was that disgusting - and don't worry i'll spare you all the details, honest.

i'll just say my bathroom floor is no larger than a 4 x 4 foot square.

but as sato sensei told me, tomorrow there was going to be another typhoon, so i, remembering the last time where i had no food or drink and had to walk through the pouring rain, so i thought i'd plan ahead. i headed off to uny where i purchased tons of food, and two things that i've never tried before.

one is saba sushi, 200 yen for this roll longer than my forearm.

and to be honest, it's not that bad...

after you take out the saba and eat the rice ;P.

the second is this small obento that didn't look half bad. it had something fried, and the usual entree of a seaweed salad and rice, which was really good until i ate the fried thing. i couldn't quite put my finger on it, but something wasn't right. after checking the packaging, i found that it was かき...

this meant oysters.

; ;

soooooooooo i thought i'd cheer myself up, let alone i wanted to dump my uneaten food in the burnables bin (since i'd have to hold it till um... tuesday, and the fish already started to stink), so i made quick pitstop at an icecream vending machine :D. which i happily ate as i was riding my bike.

and then i hit a bump.

and dropped my cone ; ;.

twas a sad day for me...

sleeping at 1:30 is not a smart decision.

she's back!!! my sweet lovable obasan who runs the chinese restaurant near by house is back! needless to say i was over joyed... and she was happy as hell to see me alive as well! but i'll get to that in a momment.

today had to be seriously the funniest thing that has ever happened to me in school (so far anyways), happened today. for this weeks lesson plan i wrote a word search for them and while they're doing it, i would occasionally give them litte hints to help them figure it out. this is when shinji raised his hand:

shinji: sensei?
me: yes shinji?
s: this is really tough!
m: hehe here's a hint /giveshint.
s: oh thank you sensei! but is this ok (another word)?

one of the words was `dial,` now on the word search imagine that you see dial, and another `d` under the `i.` then imagine as you realize your student just circled the bottom `d` and the rest of `ial.` now imagine his face as i point out the other `d` that is the correct `d`... right next to the `i.`

that was... by far... the best.

so <i>anyways</i> back to my obasan! she's back! and of course, i went to eat at her restaurant because she's been gone for a month. and to be honest, she's what helped me keep my sanity when i first got here and truly felt a wave of culture shock the first week or so. the nice thing is that she recognizes me and, well, here's the conversation that ensued:

me: okaerinasai! (welcome home)
obasan (my nickname btw): !!! you're back!! you're alive! sorry i've been very busy lately...
m: i'm very glad you came back ;D.
o: ...what have you been eating? i was so worried that you weren't eating because i was gone!
m: ...

don't get me wrong, i love her to bits. she's somewhat of a really cool temp mom that, for the first month at least, took care of me. not only that, she's one of the reasons why i'd stay in japan. yeah, her food's that good!

it's good to have her back ;D

if i didn't have susie as a friend in japan, i'd probably just hermit myself away. honest. i just, don't, like, hanging around other jet's besides her. long story.

so!

it's tuesday again, and i went to japanese class in fujinomiya with ryan and susie except this time it was different. we biked all the way. and it's uphill haha. needless to say, our legs were burning at the end of it (about a 35 minute ride up as fast as we could have gone). but today in japanese class, i got a nickname... they're all going to call me 臍曲がり (hesomagari) it's a really bad meaning nickname, but to be honest i have sort of an idea of what it means - i'll ask my supervisor tomorrow.

but the bike ride back was great. susie and i found this awesome restaurant, that gives you a full 3 course meal for two people with each entree no more than 150 yen or so, and it's only a short 10 minute bike ride from our apartments heh. so, damn, good.

but i really mean it, i love wednesdays, again, besides english club ahaha.

today was really relaxing, though for some reason teaching one class feels just the same as teaching four in a day - and i can't quite explain why. but after work today i decided to check out the kendo club and the judo club again for their last 40 minutes of practice.

today there was a master kendo teacher there. i guess to put things into persepective, the students are taking a test for their first certificate in kendo. the two instructors, saito sensei and goto sensei have their third certificate. this master has his seventh.

yeah.

but it's really great to see the other side of kendo. today, instead of bopping each other on the head with wooden sticks, they were using wooden katanas and practicing style and form.

good stuff.

and for more good stuff... susie and i grabbed some 100 yen sushi for dinner and some icecream afterwards hehe. life is good :).

...but maybe this just doesn't make sense. today is one of my more slower days and i started off with a quick peak into yamaguchi sensei's english writing class for the second years. they're learning some principles of a company - no idea why really, but here are some antics anyways:

yamaguchi sensei: well, ok class repeat after me. experience!
class: experience.
y: design!
c: design. erm... what is design...?
y: oh... well that's just, you know... the same as english?
c: ?
y: well design is just, well... a design!
c: ohhhhhhh.
me: ...

lol, then again you can't really blame her, look at what i have to teach with. this is taken straight out of my text book on using a phone:

steve: hello. this is steve speaking. may i speak to aya?
aya: aya speaking. hi, steve. how are you?
s: fine, thanks. aya, do you want to go to a baseball game with me on saturday? i'm sure it's going to be an exciting game (eff four gee!)

[cut the rest of the conversation, you get the point.]

well that, or it's straight out of a 1950's educational film on dating. one or the other, it's just weird imo.

which leads me to my lesson next week that's about describing people. this is the dialogue that came with that:

lynn: look, that's ken's girlfriend!
ichiro: where?
l: she's over there.
i: over there? what does she look like?

[long conversation deleted.]

i: wow! she's really pretty. <u>she's too good for ken.</u>

speechless.

long story in reference to ryan's relationship with his supervisor in numazu...

last night we celebrated ryan's birthday at a 焼肉(yakiniku) restaurant that's right across the street from susie's place (picture yes! sorry, been really really busy/lazy with pictures, they'll be up before next july i promise... well maybe).

it's been a hell of a weekend lately - after some pancake breakfast and what not, sofia, lawrence, susie, ryan, and i set out for numazu (about a 20 min train ride) with the intentions of dinner, bowling, and a few movies to pass the time heh.

but yeah... bowling in japan is rather nifty. first off, names are inputed for you, the display at your lane is all touch screen, and they have cheesy ways of rewarding you for marking... (no pictures sorry, you can ask and i <em>might</em> demonstrate it). but the touch screen is rather nifty. you have the choice to watch the score, tv, or a bunch of girls jumping into water (reversed) in bikini's...

that's right. jumping into water, in bikini's, with the video played backwards.

needless to say, i have no idea who won that night.

BODY:
there are spiders in japan that have a really nifty/scary trait.

they can jump. rather quickly too i might add.

today was really chill, i'm surprised i enjoy hanging out with jets from the uk more than i do from the us /random. after a breakfast/lunch of fruit and random things from the local bread shop, we headed over to an arcade near numazu eki - i can't quite remember the last time i've been to an arcade (might have been galactican mike /shrug).

and of course with every arcade, there's that one fcuker who goes everyday, who times everything perfectly (sf2), and will wipe the floor with you no matter how hard you try/practice *cou-mikewu-ugh*.

yes he kicked my arse, and yes he perfected me... with charlie... /sigh.

anyways, it's been a long weekend, and i'm in dire need of a shower hehe.

i don't know how they justify this... but blankets in japan aren't cheap. in fact they're about 100 us for one, and it's about the same thickness of a towel. nice eh?

clerk: oh you like this?
me: yeah, it's really nice.
c: oh, 14ooo yen only!
m: ... oh, what's this /pointsoutastain.
c: oh... 10ooo yen only!
m: ...i...forgot...my wallet...
c: ...
m: ...
c: ...
m: /flee

or something like that haha. but the weather's getting rather cold, or more unpredictable; one day it's hot like summer, one day it's cold as hell... we figured it be time to get blankets.

and that's what we did... those there's something strange about these blankets that i can't quite put my finger on them... they look very similar to down comforters, but i wonder why we got them for so cheap...

so at lunch today, i had to figure this out...

me: ok, so me and another alt (susie) bought blankets yesterday really cheap, 29oo yen! it's a deal right?
itou sensei: yeah, but i've never heard of that...
sato sensei: yeah me either...
supervisor: you sure that it was a blanket_? o.o
takakubo sensei: that seems fishy to me...
chouno sensei: are there straps? maybe it's a matress cover
m: but... i mean... there are no straps (matress cover), it looks just like a down blanket from the us, it's really thick, so it can't be a futon!
yamaguchi sensei: ....mmmm... you sure it's not a futon?
m: ...

note: wow i don't even know if i can remember everything that happened.

but yeah osaka was a lot of fun. and it started on the shink ride there with susie heh.

before we jumped onto the train, we ran to a convience store to grab some munchies on the 2-3 hrs shink ride over. while at conbini (katakana pronounciation) i bought a few things, but most notable - a sandwich that had an egg, and mayo and what not.

me: hungry?
susie: yes!
m: /bringsoutourfoodstash.
m: /openssandwich.
s: omg that looks like the most fattening thing ever! how can you even stomach that?
m: /shrug.
s: ...can i have a bite?

so with a map that looks like it was drawn by a 3 year old in mcdonalds, susie and i set off in osaka. the first day we hit up sky tower's beer festival, the shopping district, hep 5, the aquarium, and some of osaka's famous, okonomiyaki.

i honestly can't begin to describe anything - a picture really is worth a thousand words. will update soon!

never thougth i'd say that hahaha.

so let's get something clear. our hostile was rather ghetto. but let's ignore the fact that our walls were made of makeshift ply wood, and focus on the real problems.

like our `excersise bike.`

which was a bike, with it's backwheel propped up onto a treadmill.

i can't even begin to comprehend this.

anyways, today we set out for osaka castle, and temples galor. now something interesting is that in every temple there is a fountain of purity, in which fresh water comes from a spring below and their are wooden cups to drink out of. also it's used as a sort of cleansing ceremony for the visitors to the temple/shrine/whatever.

and this is where habit kind of fails me.

so, curious, i took a sip of the water. i washed my hands. and then i took another sip to clean out my mouth.

...and then i spit back into the fountain of purity.

...

why are there dark clouds forming all around me....?

anyways other things you should know about osaka. there is a subway and a jr. please pay attention to the signs of where each train is going. why? because one of the jr lines in osaka loop around the hole city. which is what susie and i did... accidentally.

honest.

i'm tired. i'm dripping wet. my body hurts. and i'm lacking tons of sleep.

but i had a blast in osaka. even on the train ride home on the shink, where susie and i didn't have a seat to sit in, it was so much fun. we stood near the exit, and looked through the porthole as japan passed us by.

the last day in osaka was a bit frustrating. at first nothing seemed to go right. we missed a train. shops were closed. we got lost. we couldn't find food, or a bathroom. etc. etc.

but in the end, we finally found one of the things we were looking forward to the most. we went to the temple of family, well being, travel, and safety. it's one of the biggest temples in osaka and carried with it a sense of peace and relaxation that helped one forget the burdens and stresses of the world.

(sorry for the half-assed entry, will promise a better entry when pics are up.)

heh sorry, i know it's been quite awhile since i've last updated (writing this 10/19) - but life here in japan has been picking up, and i honestly can't be bothered some days heh. to update you all at home as to what is going on, i'm teaching 16 classes a week: 12 oral communication classes for 1st years, 1 adult english course, and 3 second year writing classes. after school i check out the kendo and judo clubs till about 6:30 some nights, if not earlier, in which i get home to have dinner with susie and what not. tuesday nights i'm in a town that's a 35 minute bike ride uphill for japanese classes and i'm going to start taiko (chinese dumming) on sundays in november. in addition some other jets from all over shiz invited me to play ball with them sunday nights - so i need to figure that one out. and in my free time i'm usually (for now anyways) incredibly tired to do anything except play some games to relax and clean my apartment (been busy lately). but in order to prevent a tremendously long update for one day, i'll continue to post as if i've written them that day heh.

so anyways...

today was our first enkai! we went bowling! it's been so long heh. about 80% of the sensei's went there and we broke into 8 teams heh for some clean (minus the japanese profanity) wholesome fun. it was pretty cool, since for some of the teachers it was their first time bowling, and some of the teachers are incredibly hardcore; they have those gloves and everything.

it was great though because for some of the first time teachers, like sato sensei, who would bowl strikes up the wazoo heh... whereas i am not able to mark in the second game for the life of me ;P

but afterwards it was pretty chill. half the sensei's (myself included) went drinking at an izukaiya... where i promptly (as well as all the male sensei's) got pissed drunk and had fun with my camera... (yeah i'll most those pictures... well.. most of them).

it's funny the things you learn about sensei's when alcohol is involved... yeah i'll leave it at that..

there's been a cold going around my school lately - and as a teacher, you have about 200+ chances to catch it from the students you teach... in additon to the almost 100 sensei's as well.

and to be honest, i'm taking my vitamins, and opc (dad :p) as well as eating a lot of fruit and veges (mom ^^), but i still feel like i'm coming down with something...

but i still went bowling and drinking with my sensei's...

and (shadyness in 3...2...1) and i took the day off today hahah!

fukushima sensei: so um... jeff... you're not going to be here on friday right?
me: yeaop, i have a benkyoukai with other alts in shizuoka. <--- thought he had a day off :D
f: oh, well i've rearranged the schedule so that you can teach your class first period! <---- shot down ; ;

f: yeah, onegaishimasu! <---- bastard ;P

but yeah... so i had to go to work still for one period ;P and then left. /wavesgoodbyeto540yen.

anyways, it was pretty cool though cause i got to meet up with some really cool jets that i haven't seen for awhile. like kent, douglas, blair, amy, and even some new jets. kent is the jet i met in asunaro btw who jus got married and gave birth to his first son, sage. but yeah, good to see him again:

me: yo kent!
kent: heya jeff.
m: how's sage?
k: good, sage his crawling like no other, and he's trying to walk, but he keeps falling over :D
m: how're things?
k: not so good... he's having trouble sleeping lately...
m: that's too bad...
k: well more for my wife, i just roll over and go back to sleep <--- husband of the year!
m: haha that's not good, have you tried any common rememdies for that?
k: yeah! we have homeopathic gold beads! <--- the hell are those?
m: oh that's nor... what?!
k: gold beads... you've never heard of them?
m: shit, i was thinking more warm milk or bed time stories... so do they work at least?
k: not... really...
m: ...

ok, i remeber when friend of mine's uncle took me, him, and another friend [names left anon on purpose] to a `spa` in [yeah you know where]... and believe me, it was awkward. but there's something you need to remember though, in japan, as weird as this sounds, nobody thinks anything of it. absolutely nobody.

and they offer you `modesty` towels... which they don't try to take away from you hahahahahahahaha [hahahahahaha].

a good friend of mine in jet, brad, who also plays wow on cenarius, invited me to grab dinner and go try out a real onsen for once. ok yes it's awkward, but i mean, it's a cultural aspect of the country you're in, and as long as you're mature about it and keep admiring the roof/sky there's nothing wrong with it...

you can stop laughing ;P

dinner was really nice. there's this small italian restaurant that's made with slabs of wood and also includes a small bakery. it's a simple menu with average prices for japan and the quality of the food was slightly above par heh. no i am not trying to change the subject. you bastards.

but onsens are rather nice if you ignore <em>that</em> aspect of it. hot springs are nice, they have two saunas too, tatami rooms where you can order food and watch movies, a tv room where you get your own lazyboy recliner and tv, as well as massages from the attractice young japanese girl you might fancy (for 1600 every 20 minutes in addition to the flat 1500 to get into the onsen).

well i didn't get that though... i instead sat in ghetto-massage-chair that was massaging my back (meant for the head/neck) enjoying icecream and strawberry milk... it's not attractive young japanese girl, but hey, it was free :P.

afterwards though on the trainride home, it finally happened.

i fell asleep, and completely  missed my stop and was halfway to shizuoka... (about 20 minutes past fuji) ;P

needless to say, i got home around 12:30 am (catching the last train back and adding an hour more of travel time) where though i have work on monday, i proceeded to play wow and rolled a priest finally passing out at 2:30 in the morning [i imagine ryan to be rather proud, gg]...

after recently adding my jte's second year writing class - i've found my tuesdays to contain 5/6 classes for the day. needless to say it's rather tiring, but i really enjoy the writing class since the kids want to learn, and i can teach them really really random words that i use... for example `boat loads.`

but before that i had my first 41 student class team teaching session; this involves a full class (instead of the usual 20-21 students i teach per class) and two jtes and myself.

you think it's hard to ask them to stop talking in 20-21 students? it's near impossible with 40-41. i caught myself screaming at times just to be heard heh. but the plus side though is that this class is one of my favorites (i.e. i like both halves) because when i really need them to focus, they do it. and i only need to ask once heh.

but anyways, the writing class i have (my only one) is a lot of fun. today i asked them to do a creative writing lesson, where they had to draw pictures and pass them to me. then i shuffled, and then passed them back to the students and told them that they had to write a story with the pictures they were given (in groups of 4, so each team had four pictures).

but their pictures were boring...

so i added my own pictures.

now they have to write a story using 1. a bomb, 2. a shark, 3. godzilla, 4. a car accident, 5. yamaguchi sensei, 6. tokyo tower, 7. a rainbow, and 8. (my favorite) a curseword in japanese.

fun times ahead. ;)

it's nice when you're the teacher... cause for the most part students have to do what you say (within reason of course, and g-rated you pervs).

for example, when my students are sleepy eyed and not reading.

my rememdy: i get all the students to stand up, and make them run around for 30 seconds. if they are not running, i chase them around the class room. the penalty of not running, is you have to dance in front of the class... or sing in front of everyone... i have yet to get a student to do either of those.

go figure heh.

i can't explain why this is funny, but i was laughing rather hard when it happened:

me: good morning yamaguchi sensei.
yamaguchi sensei: good morning.
m: i figured it out, i can do all of next week's lesson next week. before we were going to start on thursday, and go to wednesday the 2nd of nov. and what not, but now we can do it all next week from the 25th, move the 26th to tuesday, and we have thursday and friday, and saturday is monday's schedule!
y: i'm sorry my brain isn't quite working yet...

hahahaha.

so some class antics. honestly i think some of the most fun i have, is when two guys are sitting next to each other and i ask them to read the dialogue in the book. and when one of the characters is a girl:

me: mikiya, seiya, please read ;D
mikiya: ok... /readsthenames
mi: ... you're jenny! /slapsseiyasbook
seiya: nooooooo you're jenny!
mi: ... oh shoot, ryo's harder... i'm jenny!
s: noooo i'm jenny!

it's a vicious cycle...

so recently an issue on how our paid time off arose with another alt friend of mine from the uk. needless to say he asked for 1 day and in turn was completely chewed out for it... so me being the curious one, wanted to see what it really was, decided to ask one of my teachers about it:

me: so what is nenkyu?
wakazono sensei: oh, it's paid time off.
m: oh really? so i can use it whenever i want?
w: yeaop.
m: oh, that's what i thought, so i can take tomorrow off if i wanted to right?
w: well.. if you don't inconvenience any teachers and if you don't have any class.
m: but i have class every day...
w: oh...right...
m: so i can't really use it when i want huh...
w: mm... no... no you can't...
w: ....

haha yeah something like that. i love work heh.

when your jte tells you that it's ok to `dress in any clothes you want,` he really means `you better still get your arse in teacher's clothes.`

there's that japanese subtlety heh.

so why do you ask i mention this?

well because i wore blue jeans, a t-shirt, flip flops, and to top it all off, a baseball cap... backwards no less. but! there was a good reason, or at least i like to tell myself that.

i took half the day off, and got to school around 11:30, and then i had to leave and head to the rose theater around 2 to setup for the culture festival tomorrow! so see? i was only at school for 2.5 hrs! even though i also happened to get there as my students walked by... and my two jte's... and some other teachers i know... and this was one of the conversations heh:

yamaguchi sensei: hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
me: good afternoon yamaguchi sensei.
y: hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
m: ...
y; hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
m: ...

[this goes on for a few more minutes]

m: what's so funny...?
y: you (with my backwards hat on) look like a highschool drop out!
m: ...
y: i don't know if they'll let you into the rose theater, or even into the teachers room looking like that...
m: but this is what i normally wear...
y: hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
m: so what should i do?
y: you should hide from akimoto sensei (vice principal)... actually let's go into the staff room and see what happens!
m: ...
y: :D

mmm so i went into the staff room. for the last time.

well ok, more of a super-covert-mission-impossible-I-style entrance.

objective; to make sure the vice principal was not there.
method: to make it to my desk, undetected, and hide my pants.
level of difficulty: 7/10 - hard not to notice the foreigner... let alone the tallest person at my school.

this entry will self destruct in 10 seconds.

mmm ok, well more of a club day to be exact. but it's pretty cool. every (yes i have pictures, no i haven't updated, working on it!) club gets to set up in a room and have posters and contests, and really nifty things - like tea ceremonies, story time, and candy (english club did a halloween theme woo!).

it was tons of fun. when the opening ceremonies started, they would show each homerooms kind of `message` to the school - and it usually involved tons of randomness - working on getting a copy of it hehe.

in addition each club that could perform put on a bit of a show. the guitar club had two rock concerts, which weren't so bad (have some videos), the drama club put on a skit about the relationship between the passing line, and the scores around it.

and don't ask me how, but it involved a man in a school girl outfit (no not me ;P).

all i really got out of that skit was the girl who played 59 (the score) looking at 60 (man in drag) across the passing line (a red line) and yelling:

59: i love you!
...
...
...
60: /waitstillshewalksoff i know!

heh. all i have to say is that our brass band is awesome heh (pics and a video!!)

then we had the dance team also (which they made me promise that i'd watch them, this is the same dance team that i met in august who told me to date a teacher.... ;P) but yeah, tons of fun hehe.

anyways, tired as hell, i'll be back tomorrow heh.

susie is the best. and i don't think that explains enough.

you see she's the only person i told my birthday to, and i told her time and time again (every time she brought it up) that i don't want anything. that i didn't expect anything.

so what did she do?

she came to my house and woke me up with doorbells. she brought me a present and cake. we had a great lunch, and headed towards the movie theater, and as if i couldn't be any more impressed...

most of my friends were there waiting for me. she did all of this, without me knowing, and for the first time - i was surprised beyond belief. i can't explain to you how happy i was. even though it was simply a movie, some time in an arcade - where i learned sofia, blair, and i have a bad addiction to those grabby games... and the ones in japan only have 2 claws... you bastards! - it was tons of fun.

and we still spent 5 bucks on it.

and we didn't win.

but it was great... drinks, food, crepes, everything.

thanks guys, you're the best.

nothing really happend, so i'll just throw in more class antics heh.

sometimes i ask for students to volunteer in class. but of course most don't because it's rather embarassing (not my fault) honestly (i like chiken). but <i>sometimes</i> you get the best combination.

the gung-ho student paired with the chicken student.

me: ok who would like to volunteer?
yuuta (judo student, awesome kid btw): /w let's volunteer!
chicken student: /w nooo... no no no... no.... 
yuuta: mr. jeff wants to give hanko! dooo it!
c: no....
y: BE A MAN!

<i>do the right thing...</i> hahahaha, ok random moment, and i doubt most of you will get it heh. yuuta is a great student heh. pleasure to have in class. (remind you of those elementry school report cards?)

but speech contests in japan are complete bs. why?

1. the judges are japanese. i don't mean to be biased, but they have no ear for correct english. just the same as we have no ear for correct japanese.

2. the judges stressed pronounciation was key, but the three winners in the recitation side had the worst pronounciation that i've heard. they won because 1. the person before them choked so badly. 2. they used 7,000,000 gestures to hide their inability to speak clearly. i can understand if my student doesn't win, or place, but damn it the one's the judges did choose just sucked ass.

3. the judges themeselves had jobs <b>completely</b> unrelated to the english field except for 1 non-japanese university professor, and even then i don't even think she taught english.

4. they wouldn't know good english if it bit them in the ass.

/endrant.

in all honesty though. i'm proud of chihiro (my student). she did everything that hara sensei and i asked of her, and more. she tried her very best, and in my honest opinion as a native speaker, only one girl could have potentially outdone her. but chihiro also picked the hardest essay to read - all the winners picked (honestly) the easiest essay. that was just bs.

in the end, she's come along so far. her pronounciation is far superior to any first year student that i know - even better then some of my jte's. i would not have, nor will i ask her to sacrifice correct pronounciation to win a crap contest.

you're first place in my eyes chihiro. hara sensei and i are so proud of you.

today we had our somewhat monthly assembly at school - where the principal recognizes those students who have placed in any competition and what not, in addition sends a message (of some sort or another) to the entire school.

and as usual, it's all in japanese.

and as usual i understand about 0% of the entire thing.

fun times for me.

but apparently i'm not the only one:
me: kikuchi sensei, i, don't really understand anything...
kikuchi sensei: it's ok, i'll tell you a secret, i don't either.
m: that's bad right?
k: nah i can safely guarantee that 90% of the people here don't understand what's going on.
m: ok, well i'll just go ask a jte.
k: i meant including the teachers...
m: oh...

mmm... so to prove a point:

me: sensei (for future reference, i only refer to my supervisor as just `sensei`), um, can you explain what the principal was talking about? it seemed important.
sensei: um... i... wasn't listening... i kind of stop paying attention everytime she starts talking ^^;.
m: そか...

yeah. i. um... yeah. just yeah.

BODY:
shoot, it's been really busy these last few weeks, and more to come heh. hopefully though i haven't forgotten all of it, and will try to update things chronologically as well heh.

so let's start with some fresh antics heh.

my students these days are working on their final projects. the final project this year is a skit that a group of 2-3 have to present in front of the class. lately each class goes through phases of writing it in japanese, translating to english, making props, and finally presenting (roughly).

soooo let's go to my 14 homeroom (the difficult class, but not so bad now cause i don't have to teach). so during these classes, i carry around with me a japanese-english dictionary which, honestly, has been one of the more useful things i bring to work.

chinami: sensei, we need help please.
me: ok.
haruka (they're partners): how do we say [japanese phrase] in english?
m: um... i don't know, i know! my best friend! /opensdictionary.
c: omg serious? how sad! you have no friends!
h: the dictionary is really your best friend?
c: it's ok sensei, we'll be your friends!
h: no... he has to have friends!
h: ... right?

heh, yeah... haha.

moving on to 15 homeroom with yamaguchi sensei. btw i was incredibly impressed with what these two have done. the average skit i've seen will last no longer than 1 minute - whereas they have filled the page and it will clearly be at least 5 minutes (the requirement):

miyuki: sensei, we need help please.
me: of course! /walksover. yes?
fumi (partners): we need help translating this please.
m: /takes a look. what does this mean? [they are directions].
f: oh, well you see the road turns, and then turns, and then at the red light... and then...

and i am not joking. i saw this on their paper and even made a photocopy as proof.

`it turns the following signal right, it turns to the left afterwards, it takes a right, and it turns to the left then, because a <strong>gay</strong> hourse comes into view for a moment.`

i had to leave the room laughing. after about 5min.

m: so you meant `grey house right?`
mi: no.. we meant はで. (yes that means `gay`)

remember you're a teacher jeff. remember. hold it back. anyways, i was halfway finishing up with helping them translate their skit, when the bell ring. i told them if they wanted more help that they could come by after shool and i'll help translate for them.

so... after school...:

m and f: sensei! please help us finish!
me: /nod.

after awhile of correcting.

m: ok so what are you trying to say here?
mi: well we want to say that yamaguchi sensei came to the wrong house.
m: ok and?
f: well for example, she came to the gay house.

...

mi: i think it'd be pink or something.

...

(it hurts).

Hey, you're not dead after all!  Good to hear!  ^_^

Thanks for sharing your fun school stories.  That reminds me, for the cooking presentation I had my students do, one group of guys did yakiniku.  I told them they had to have at least five steps.  They started with "raise the cow and pig"...and yes, "butcher" was one of the steps.  Did I mention I made sign language and pictures a requirement?  XD

part 2!

it took a week of planning. mass emails up the wazoo, and finally it all came together. john and i planned thanksgiving dinner in fujinomiya (many thanks to doug for loaning us his place) for the fuji crew and guests - and to be honest it was awesome.

though there was no turkey, or a table and chairs for that matter, we had plenty of food and drink to go around ten fold (pictures? yes). on the menu were: chicken legs, carrots and pineapples, mashed potatoes, fried rice, yakisoba, potato salad, salad, chinese yakiniku, curry, thai curry, garlic bread, mushrooms and celery, white rice (of course), apple pie, damn and a lot more than that.

let's just say doug will have a ton of leftovers to last him till christmas at least heh. i think that sums it up pretty well. good food, good friends, good times.

...and beware the deer in nara.

ok so this was around 11/30 when i had just wrapped up my first quarter on jet heh:

the second year students are heading out to their school trip to osaka and nagasaki this year next monday. sooo, in trying to be a little more responsible, i'm trying to get all my jte's, who have to go, to finish up the presentation grades for my first year students heh.

so the presentation grades for my students works like most oral presentations. you get points for x, and points for y, sum them up, and you get their total. now one thing i hadn't planned on was that they had double the preparation time then what was previously mentioned. so in an effort to balance this, i doubled their points for my preparation category and divided by two to get the correct amount.

and it worked well for the most part.

until you get the 1.5, 2.5, 3.5... this is out of 4 total points btw.

and it gets even better when the student is one either i, the jte, or both of us don't like...

so how do we decide whether to round up or down?

a scientific process? a gruelling thought of hoo the student performed during the quarter?

haha yeah right.

rock-paper-scissors baby!

Dude, I know!  I always loved doing my laundry on either Saturday or Sunday mornings back at college cos: (1)it was the one or two times during the week I had time to play, and (2)since it was the weekend hardly anyone else was up then so I always got to do my laundry without a wait.  :D

read it in spanish.

hahahahaha. (it was the name of a gas station in gotenba.)

today doug and i headed towards gotenba, where, apparently the only outlets in japan are(people come from all over the country). and there's just one rather interesting fact:

this outlet is run by the same people who run the gilroy outlets back home.

so why have an outlet store in the middle-of-nowhere, japan?

no idea.

not that we were complaining, but, doug and i managed to get a productive day out of it. the nice thing about this place is that there are us stores in addition to stores most of us have never heard of (jp stores). for example i saw one store that caught my eye; sony plaza. now what goodies could you possibly imagine that you would be able to find in a store such as this? the ps3? all the lastest and greatest gadgets that sony has ever graced the face of the earth with?

oh no. even better than that in my opinion. sony plaza is a supermarket for american products. that's right. i bought my bottle of shout there damn it. i don't care that it cost 7 bucks, if you can find shout anywhere else in ALL of japan, please let me know. till then, me and my bottle of shout are going to do some laundry.

that's right. and you're not invited.

so nieh.

you're damn right i am. /thumbsup.

this was found in the bathroom at <a href="http://www.fujikyu.co.jp/fuji-q/">fujikyu highland</a>. at the end of each term, the students get to go on a class trip so to speak, and so this year they decided to go to fujikyu.

just ignoring the fact that it's about 32 degrees outside, and my kids are wearing skirts... and they dress kind of, questionably. and some of them look like clowns... which is apparently popular atm.

/shrug.

anyways, check out fujiyama, and dodonpa (the top two on the left side)! i went on fujiyama once - reminds me a lot of goliath in magic mountain - and dodonpa 3 times - because it's like superman except faster i think. fun as hell, except japanese roller coasters are kind of dodgey, why? well though they say there's a minimum height requirement, they don't seem to have a max height requirement, and so some of those girders on fujiyama made me duck a few times... paranoia, maybe, but remember!

you are handsome guy!

ok, i'm grading the finals for my students this weekend. and to be honest, it wouldn't be so bad except for one thing; circle = right, and check = wrong.

now maybe it's me, but when something is wrong, you circle where it's wrong, i.e. an answer right? and if it's right, you check it as if they got the point.

needless to say my student's papers are looking kind of sloppy...

maybe i'll give them a few bonus points ;P.

my bad man, honestly it's worked out kind of funny. at first i thought that i only had a week of vacation time for christmas and new years, so i just wanted to go somewhere cheap - i.e. 800 us to come home for a week... meh. the other thing is that taiwan is close by and i have family there - you can always go to hk you know... which i thought you were - and so i arranged that instead.

and then what i thought would only be using '2' days of pto, ended up using 10, and thus i could have come back to the us for 3 weeks, but then by now it's too late to change... so...

my bad. haha

huh?

i just had the absolute weirdest conversation with my japanese teachers.

they wanted me to lower my kids grades so they fall into the school's regulation of keeping the average between 5 and 6; think of it like the us system, except that instead of out of 100, they base it out of 10, so move that ol decimal over and you got it. btw, passing here is a 3, i think the us should learn something from this hehe. shoot, this is really frustrating because my students averaged about a 70% on my final, but they said `yeah that's too high.` ...what?

but i can't believe they asked me to do that. yeah there are kids that are little punks, but i'm not going ot lower any of their scores because of it (though incredibly tempting). it comes across like this:

fred: hey bob, yeah, your kids are doing too well in schol.
bob: yeah isn't that great?
f: yeaaaaaah, no we can't have any of that. doing well in school? that's unheard of!
b: ...uh...huh? why?
f: yeaaaah...
b: ...that doesn't answer my question.
f: yeaaaah...
b: ...

and then they brought up that companies don't want kids to excel in english over other subjects? i, what, huh? what the hell does that have to do with anything? so they're good at english, that's like a bonus imo. some of my kids are damn good at english, and i'm not going to sell them short because of it! what kind of a teacher is that?

isn't it the better the kids do, the better off everyone is? does something not add up here, or is it just me...?

Heh.  Ah yes, but see, you are now in BIZZAROLAND!  Where thinking is only for the upper echelons and is used as a tool with which to control the masses.  We can't very well educate everyone - that will harm the 和 you silly American-college-educated foreigner!  Do you want to be responsible for uprising and disunity?  You'd best remember your position here, Young Padowin Skywalker.  ;)

But yeah, seriously, stuff like that pisses me off too.  By the way, if you're bored at work (hahaha, "if"; you're on JET - of course you are) check out http://www.debito.org for some educational reading.  It's good stuff; I promise.

hey guys, long time no update, and i'm seriously sorry. was in taiwan from the 19th to the 6th and, well, had no internet access either. in addition i'm deeply sorry to all of you; i had computer problems and ran norton cause i thought it would help (mainly slowdown from fragmentation).

turns out it errored on me, told me to reboot, and i couldn't get into my os after that. so, that means, no pictures... i don't mind losing the music, the movies, etc. but the pictures thing is what really bugs me.

on the up side, we did a data recovery to my hd and found a file that was 60gb, so there is hope still.

just need to figure out how to open it.

so anyways, got back into fuji around the 6th at night, and it was SNOWING! it's the first time in four years (it's also the coldest winter some say) but yeah, i haven't really seen snow fall where i lived before... it was nice, cold, but nice.

nothing new really these days. i'm trying a new methodology of teaching which has the potential to go really well or really horrible, but i guess we'll see.

i'm trying a full class of 40 twice a week vs. a class of 20 once a week.

i'll keep you guys informed. also i'm going to re-edit some november entries (not that you'll read them) but there were some great stories in november that i have saved, just never published.

take care.

haha ok this is from a november entry i never finished.

there was this one time (11/14) where i started cooking with the third years. the project of that day was to make miso soup, but the one with pork meat in it (forgot what it's called). unfortunately, they don7t really make the soup from scratch, and instead they just used prepackaged stuff (looked like fat in a bag.) and then...

student 1: ok jeff, just open the bag.
me: ok /opensthebag.
student 2: now squeeze it out into the tubber ware.
m: ok. /doesit.
student 3: you got some on your fingers! you should lick it off! try it, it's good!
m: ... ok, if you say so. /lick.
m: !!! (imagine eating something sour as all hell) :x <---. bleh!
1: hahahahahaha.
m: ok you guys have miso on your fingers too! are you going to...
1, 2, 3: /washestheirhands.
m: ...

just write `sucker` on me.

ok back up and running. also, all entries are updated; i read through november and it was fine imo, also i brought the entries to present date and finished cleaning up a few things.

also on a recent note: i haven't checked the blog recently and noticed a bot has apparently spammed the crap out of my comments section. i have deleted all posts (please let me know if i miss any) and banned the ip. they totalled to about 1000 posts /wavesangryfist.

sorry for the slow updates lately. been rather busy/lazy/gone. so here's a quick update on what's going on with me:

monday: go to work, then go to a small ramen shop in a town far away for dinner with friends.
tuesday: go to work, watch my kids do kendo/judo/kyudo, eat dinner, and sleep 10-12 hrs (cause it feels so good...).
wednesday: go to work, come home and play games.
thursday: go to work, watch my kids do kendo/judo/kyudo, hang out with friends.
friday: go to work, then go hang out with friends/jets/etc.
saturday: usually crashed at a friend's place, go onsen-ing, get dinner with friends, then relax and play games.
sunday: running errands/laundry/etc. maybe start taiko soon.

as to my plans to do aikido, it turns out they only meet once a week. and it's 50 bucks a week... so nuts to that!

and for the most part those are my days. up and coming things are...:

this weekend i'm going snowboarding in nagano. doesn't that just sound cool? i'm so god-awful at snowboarding, but man, i just like saying it haha. i'm going snowboarding in nagano!

next weekend i'm off to hokkaido with ryan and susie to see the snow festival.

and that's pretty much all that's going on. having fun in japan, and feeling like i'm finally starting to make use of what's in front of me. hope things are all going well back home.

alright there was ONE (ok, three, but who's counting right?) story i forgot to bring you guys up to date. and this happened in november/december ish.

as a requirement, all teachers must attend a sexual harassment awareness coarse.

did i mention it's all in japanese?

did i mention that they have no words for certain terms in regards to sexual harassment... thus the use of katakana.

did i mention i had to go?

me: /wave
kyoko: /wave back
m: i get to go to a sexual harassment seminar in japanese
m: wheeee
k: niiiiice
m: and here i go ;P
k: woooooooohooooooooooooooooooo

so yeah...

anyhoo so from the 2 hrs i had to spend in there, this is what i got out of it. btw, they put me next to my supervisor so she could `translate` everything for me.

did i mention that all the badwords are in katakana?

and if you don't know what katakana is, then it's basically engrish.

so in the midst of japanese lecturing, i was privelaged to hear the random sexual harassment terms.* (im me if you want to see them.)

so anyways. the next part was where we were given certain situations. you know those normal situations that teachers find themselves with students. for instance, the one where the gym teacher loves watching the girls run so much, he makes them run naked. we've all heard these stories a billion times and so forth. but the fun really came when they asked us to rate them individually on a scale of 1 - 5.

so on the second one, i asked my supervisor (cause it's all in jp) what it meant:

sensei: ah, for this one /skimsit, this one says, if a student is at a computer, and the teacher is sitting really close to her.
me: ah, how close? like this /standsnexttoher, or this /sitsnexttoher.
s: yeah like that.
m: that's not too bad (it's not really...). i'll give it a 2. (1 is not that bad, 5 is full blown law suit).

then the fun part was when we all had to share (with the other teachers) what we rated.

it was 5's across the board.

<em>wait a minute</em>...

m: sensei, why is everone saying it's a 5? this isn't that bad right?
s: /skimsagain. oh i'm sorry. the teacher is sitting next to the student, and the teacher touches her breasts.
m: !!!
s: what?
m: that's ENTIRELY DIFFERENT!
s: yeah i know, why did you rate it a 2?
m: ...

fun times...

no really.

*i mean no offense to anyone, and yes i understand how serious this is, but god i couldn't stop laughing.

mmm if i remember right.

1. the gym teacher thing.
2. my story.
3. a teacher always offers a student a ride home (personally i don't see that as so bad; some of my kids ride their bike for an hour to get to school :P).
4. a teacher makes someone stay after class. and then says to the student, `you can either do some ridiculously pain in the butt thing, or you can give me a kiss!` (was laughing rather hard at this one).
5.[ok i can't remember the fifth one...]

and did you need a place to crash at the snow festival?

alright, so if any of you recall (or can find, i was looking for it, but can't find the post) where i asked the second year students to write a story using 5-7 things of my own creation and pictures that they've drawn... and the most interesting thing that came out of it, was when i asked them to use a curse word.

this, is one of the student's curse words (hiroko)...:

then ms. yamaguchi said,`てめえ、マヂちょうしの、てんじゃねぇよ。サメ食うなんざ100万年早ぇんだよ。このボけ！

hahahahahaha... um... that somewhat translates to... um... i'll get back to you on that one.

mmmm.

alright, so my kids are working on their in-class test for the third quarter this year (final one too yay!) and this time, it's show and tell. the problem is, most of my kids are lazy, no wait, just 14 homeroom is lazy (they're the `smart` ones too haha). but as my jte says, `it's just a label.`

but during this time (about 3-4 classes) i'm asked to help them translate their japanese into english (which is a really good exercise for me) and in turn i get to learn a few things about each student and have some fun.

so after grading about 10/21 topics on pens, pencils, and pencil cases... my jte says to me after class:

this is a loose translation btw ;P

kurebayashi sensei (this is the nice old jte btw): what the hell was that!?
me: ??
k: did you read half of that garbage? pens, pencils, pencil cases!
m: haha
k: smart class [my ass!], HA! more like complete idiots!
m: ^^;
m: maybe they just like their pens/pencils/pencil cases ;P
k: lazy sacks of...

i actually found some of them worthwhile to read...

today was the graduation ceremony for the 三年生's.

though i didn't know a lot of them, i still knew a small amount. the ones who helped me clean the english room, the ones who took chinese, the ones who took the 英検 (english proficiency exam), the ones who i got to cook with a few times, and finally the ones who spoke to me now and then in the halls.

i will always remember あぽ and /patpat.

i was honestly surprised to see that the atmosphere was more somber than joyus. whereas back home, high school graduation was a time of celebration and smiles. but in japan, it's a rather sad moment, where students burst into tears because they have to say goodbye.

anyways, it was a nice moment. all the junior class members brought gifts for their 先輩's, their seniors. i got to speak with the ones who have found themselves in my life and thank them for all the silly things and nice conversations we'd have on bus rides home in the rain. of course i also have pictures of most (the ones i could find) and what not. in all honesty i hope it's not the last time i get to see them.

but as one student said to me in the end, 「またいつか。。。。。。ね。」

`until next time we meet.`

yesterday was not without antics! for example:

2/28:
me: sensei, i know i should wear a suit tomorrow, but what color shirt/tie should i wear?
sensei: oh anything, wear whatever you want, just not something flashy.
m: ah, so can i wear all black please? black shirt, black tie?
s: of course! no problem!
3/1:
me: /walks-up-in-a-black-ensemble.
s: jeff why're you wearing that... you look like you're going to a funeral... you shouldn't come to graduation dressed like that...
m: but you said...
yamaguchi sensei: jeff... are you going to a funeral?
m: no but...
itou sensei: what're you wearing!? is there a funeral?
m: but i thought...

i think japan is just out to get me... at least my students thought i looked cool :)

students: you look like mafia!
other students: かっこいいじゃん！
etc., etc., etc.

but yeah, so as i was leaving it began to rain. and me, forgetting my umbrella on the bus one day, have no umbrella (it wasn't raining when i biked there). soo, obviosuly i go to the store to buy one (in addition to a boat load of other things). so everything is going great, i have the umbrella over me, a basket full of stuff, and i'm slowly making my way home without dying.

until i got to the last stretch and (this is an umbrella with a 65cm radius might i remind you and when i'm cycling i have limited/zero visibility) and my umbrella gets knicked by a pole off to my side.
when i get home i see that it has completely bent the metal rods inside... and as i try to straighten the rods i end uup breaking two of them... in addition i thought <em>maybe if i close it...</em>

this ends up snapping all the rods.

i have some nice blue cloth for sale though... -_-;

BODY:
so last quarter i promised my students that i would reward them for the amount of hanko that they'd get (basically amount of participation).

knowing me being the lazy bastard that i am... i put it off till the last day they are all 1st year students...

so what do i do? i thought cleverly that i could write down all the names, and affix it to the blackboard in each room to let them know to come find me.

and then yamaguchi sensei comes to me:

yamaguchi sensei: um... jeff?
me: yeah?
y: you asked a lot of students to come see you... is there any reason why?
m: yes!
y: is it about the final exam?
m: nope.
y: in class test?
m: nope.
y: so what is it for then?
m: the participation in the second term.
y: ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
m: why?
y: cause we have a lot of students panicing right now.
m: eh?
y: cause when you post names on the blackboard... that means that student is in a lot of trouble.
m: ...
m: ...
y: ...
m: ...oops?

good job me!

Heh, <i>nice</i>.  Always good to scare the bejesus outta the students.  ;)

Here's a thought: since it's Japan, would it be the beShinto-Buddhist instead?  Things to ponder...

my kids had final exams last week, and i seriously couldn't be bothered to do anything last week either, so i guess it works out in the end hehe.

but yeah, this term's bonus question was intended to keep them from using 分かない (in the most annoying voice, ever, think nails on a chalk board for some students...). but yeah, so i asked them a question that i knew they (nor myself) would know the answer to.

q: what is the population of canada?

and i wrote: *hint: 3 words.

so, my best responses so far:

1. no i isn't!
2. snow
3. to speak english
4. i'm going to speak english to a school
5. many kinds of foods
6. enjoy
7. statue of liberty
8. avril lavigne
9. canada, new zealand, and australia
10. i go to the 3 words
11. it is english
12. the great wall
13. JAL
14. it's five
15. no
16. chocolate
17. sky

lately we've been having junior high school kids take the high school entrance exams at my school. the three biggest parts of it are: japanese, math, and english. now, to give me something to do, they asked me to sit and help advise them on various questions.

particulary the free answer parts.

yamaguchi sensei: hey jeff, question!
me: yes yamaguchi sensei.
y: what do you think of this?
m: /reads: country is.
m: huh... well, that's kind of right...
y: well you see, the question is `does ken's uncle live in the city or the country?`
m: ah... well, where is it?
y: in the country. so i'm going to give him 1 point cause he wrote `country.`
m: ok... /grabsanothertest-flipsittoananswerwhereshealsogave1pt
m: now, you see this answer?

ken's uncle live in country.

y: yes.
m: you gave this one point... so, how can you give `country is.` one point? that means it's the same quality as this sentence /points.
y: but maybe he meant `country is... where my uncle lives?`
m: he put a period there. that's where it kind of, you know, stops.
y: ...ah.

these are my potential students next year /joy!

Heh, you got to help "advise" with the entrance exam grading too?  Wasn't that a fun experience?  XD

And hooray for helping grading finals being over.  I had a one-on-one interview part, with each of my 80 ichinensei.  To say it had gotten repetitive by the end would be an understatement.  -_-;

BODY:
been having a busy 3 days, anyways, i figured i needed to get out of the teacher's office today and went off to visit my kids who did kendo and kyudo (japanese archery). the cool thing about kyudo is the fact that it doesn't start till highschool; i.e. kendo students have been practicing since they were 8, where as kyudo students start freshman year in highschool - this means i can start too!

plus a lot of my students (7/11) are in the club, and it's pretty cool being able to share in their hobbies ; ).

today kana, hitomi, mihoko, and mari all showed me the proper ways to shoot an arrow, in addition let me actually hold a real bow and practice the form myself. naturally i asked a lot of questions to clarify certain points (depends on how much was lost in translation heh) and we reached the point where they wanted to show me an arrow. after a few minutes of searching, kana finds me a blue arrow, and comes to show me:

kana: this is a 'ya'
me: gotcha
hitomi: this is your bow, or 'yumi'
me: right
mari: this is your 'kege,' glove, and your 'nakakege,' the inner glove
me: you bet
m: so kana, is a blue arrow special? is it for beginners? or for a person taller than 180 cm? is it lighter? faster? more forgiving?
k: actually... it's just a color... you can just pick an arrow of your favorite color and shoot it.
m: you don't say... ;P

ok, so there isn't more than meets the eye, but hey some... things... are color coded...

...

right?

sato sensei: well there are a few staff workers, and the other teachers are teachers.
m: ah.

new lesson planning:

m: so we should ask them simple questions, things that are quite obvious neh?
yamaguchi sensei: yeah! like famous baseball players, and what's the color of an orange?
m: ... isn't it... orange?
y: oh yeah...

silly instant messaging:

m: hey -_-
xae: Now, now, you can't fake it now. My existence makes you joyful, it's out of the bag.
m: well...

BODY:
rest in peace, jonathan kang. my prayers are with you and your family. there's something i want you all to read as well. this is a journal entry from jon's brother, jack.

My Brother Jon
Hi everybody. Before everybody who already knows what happens gets too freaked out, let me just tell you that this is Jack, Jon's brother. As most of you know, Jon passed away last Saturday, April 8, at about 7:25pm. Jon was so detailed in writing down his thoughts and updates about his medical conditions that my parents and I agreed that Jon would have wished for somebody to bring this journal to a close, and not leave out the last few updates. I actually managed to figure out / reset his LiveJournal password a couple of days ago, but I could not bear to actually write this article until today. Even then, I've spent the good part of the last two hours doing idle tasks to put off this duty of writing. (Actually I wrote half of this article Monday night, but could not continue and actually finished it today)

My literary skill is nowhere near as good as Jonathan's, so you will have to excuse me. It was one in many skills in which he was better than me at, only he never knew it. I know that he looked up to me and never thought that he was as good as me in things, but I hope he has figured out now that he was much, much better than me in lots of the important things. I'll try to maintain as much of his style as I can, and provide the great details of the hospital and medical tools and Jon did so well.

I think that Jon's final entry took us to last Saturday. He was taking the AVN-944 every day like a Swiss watch. Jon was so on top of things that he was completely aware of how to schedule his breakfast and dinners so that he could eat the medicine at the same times each day. He kept a chart of when he took the medication, and kept it neat and organized. Despite this, however, the drug was not having the desired effect: Jon's white count kept rising. I think that Jon has explained this before, but in a healthy person, a person's white blood count ranges from 8-13 thousand per mL or something like that. I am not sure exactly what the unit of measurement is, but 8-13 is the baseline value. During chemotherapy, Jon's counts would be at 0.1 for extended periods of time, making him very susceptible to infection. The week of Spring break, Jon's counts were in the mid 20s most of the week. Pretty high, but not high enough to really bother him. The battle between the leukemia and his body was going on.

On a side note, I want to thank all of his friends who came during Spring break. Jon was very fortunate to have all of these friends, and he was soooo happy during that week. As luck would have it, his counts would really take off just as spring break ended. Thursday of spring break it grew to 42.4, and Friday it grew to 55.8. By Sunday, it had shot up to 78.5, with 86.5 on Monday, 97.5 on Tuesday. It was around Monday that Jon really began feeling tired, and some pain on his side. The pain was due to an enlarged spleen (the spleen tries to process all the white blood cells). It was causing him pain whenever he moved around. The doctors started Jon on a pill called hydroxysomething that was a form of chemo, to also help the AVN-944. While he was still at home the entire week, my mom did notice that Jon was a lot more tired, and didn't have his usual energy as often as he did before. He was probably still IMing like crazy though I bet.

Thursday night Jon spent at home watching the Sharks game. His spleen was causing him a lot of pain, but it did not prevent him from cheering wildly as the Sharks beat the Kings by a score of 5-0. He was so excited to watch them play that for a couple of hours it didn't matter what his counts were, or how big his spleen was, or how close he was (37.8) to developing the dreaded 38 degree fever (which would mean he'd have to go to the hospital)--he was just a kid watching his favorite teams win and jump into a playoff spot.

Friday morning, Jon had his regularly schedule trip to the ITA in the morning. He rode in a car with my parents, and along the way began to feel quite tired, and experiencing the typical effects of the low blood pressure / fever. It had happened again. When he got to the ITA, they tried to treat him there, but his condition quickly worsened and they decided they could not do enough for him there. They wanted to send him to the ICU, but there were no beds available at the time, so he had to go to the ER for the time being. At the ER, he was put into a pediatric room (again, lack of beds), and he was there for most of the morning/afternoon getting poked and prodded and tested. The pediatric rooms are just like the regular rooms, except the beds were a couple of inches too short for Jon. It was also much more decorated than the regular rooms, and there was even an Apple computer that the patient or patient's family could use to surf the web! 

A room opened up for Jon in the afternoon, and he was moved up to the E-2 Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Once there, he was kept on two different drugs to keep his blood pressure up. The blood pressure, like it always was, was the big concern. Jon also received a bag of platelets that I had donated earlier in the week, as well as all his standard antibiotic drugs. The doctors figured that this episode was caused by an infection, and not by the leukemia itself. However, the fact that his white blood counts were SO high made it that much more difficult for the limited resources in his body to fight off the infection. Things were not looking too good.

I had actually been to the hospital earlier in the morning, as my scheduled platelet donation for Jonathan coincided with his unexpected trip to the ER and ICU. I talked to him a little bit in the morning, but I don't think he was completely aware of what I was saying at the time. I also spoke with the doctors regarding Jon. In the evening, after work, I arrived for the 8pm visiting slot. The nurse actually let me stay through the evening until my parents came and visited Jon as well at about 10. Jon asked me how the treatment was going and what the doctors had said. I told him that it appeared as if the AVN-944 was not having the desired effect. At the same time, it was not doing him any harm, so he could continue to take it until the doctors all met and discussed his next treatment options. I asked him how he would feel if he had to do chemo again, and for the first time I could sense some hope disappearing from his eyes as he answered in his typical "I dont know" fashion.

As Friday night became Saturday morning, Jon improved. At about 5:30 am they were able to take him off of the blood pressure medication. For unknown reasons, Jon quickly got worse, developing a fever of 41 degrees (105.8), a very high heart rate of 180, and severe shortness of breath. Visiting hours are limited in the ICU, so the family was at home that night. (In the ICU, there is a single nurse that is there all the time with the patient). The nurse called the family at about 9:30 in the morning to tell us that we should go to the hospital asap. We all rushed there and arrived at about 10am. We probably arrived at the peak of Jon's condition, as he slowly got better after we arrived. His temperature began dropping very slowly, as did the heart rate. During this time, Jon was placed on an oxygen mask to help him breath. 

There were two things that morning that stood out to me. Jon was very tired the entire day, and would only spend a few minutes awake followed by longer moments of sleep. Everybody could tell he was very tired. Right after we arrived, Jon managed to wake up, and the first thing he asked me was "What time do the sharks play again?!?" I told him it would be Sunday at 5, against the Dallas Stars. I never thought that we wouldn't be able to watch that game together. 

The other thing that stood out was when he asked the nurse for his medication. Actually, asked is putting it too nicely. He quickly awoke out of his nap, and excitedly questioned the nurse as to where his medicine was. "Where's my medicine? I need to take my medicine now!" Like I said before, he was on top of his schedule like nobody else. The nurse assured him that one of the other nurses was bringing the pill soon, and he calmed back down. His pills are usually kept in the refrigerator, so they're somewhat cold when he takes them. This time, however, the nurse had taken the pills out before she started filling out all these forms for the medicine, so that 20 minutes had probably passed before Jon actually took it. When he did, the first thing he said was "HEY! THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE COLD!" Jon was a fighter to the end...oh how much he wished to live and fight and defeat this illness.

Jon had not eaten anything for over two days now when he asked mom to get him an ice cream sandwich. I was surprised when he was able to finish eating it all. It was one of those Nestle kinds that come in the yellow packaging, with two cookies and vanilla ice cream in the middle. He was so cute when he was eating it--I had to place a napkin on his chest to catch the pieces that fell down. 

By the afternoon Jon's temperature and heart rate had returned back to normal. The only concern was his breathing--it was very labored. He would often grab at his oxygen mask to hold it tighter in an effort to get more oxygen. The nurses compared it to running up a large hill. Your body is tired and is trying to get more oxygen. You could see the struggle in his chest with each breath that he took. The family and Jon had decided earlier that he did not with for a breathing tube to be put down his throat. The reason for the tube is to help people breathe artificially. 

Typically, a tube is put down the throat to buy the doctors more time. In some cases, the person recovers well enough to be able to breath again without the tube. In other cases, the person does not, and the family has to make a very hard to decision as to when to remove the tube. Either way, while the tube is in, the patient cannot speak, and often times cannot communicate to the family either. The doctors had told us the decision was up to us, but that they were not going to have a treatment option for the underlying condition of the leukemia, so it would only prolong his suffering, in addition to the grief that would accompany any decision to take the tube out.

Saturday afternoon, Jon would have received the breathing tube had we not decided as a family to not put it in. His breathing deteriorated and he began coughing up some blood. At first it was just a slight cough and some blood, but it got worse as it went on. His lack of platelets probably contributed greatly to his body's inability to stop the bleeding. As fate would have it, some of Jonathan's favorite nurses from F ground had come to visit him. Two of them arrived earlier throughout the day, but 5 others showed up immediately after their shift had ended at 7pm. All of his old nurses, mom, dad, and I were with him every step of the way.

He kept coughing, and in between his hyperventilated breaths, he asked "why can't I calm down!?" The nurses gave him morphine and another medication to try to relax him. His breathing slowed down as the family continued to hold him and tell him how much we loved him, how proud we were of him, and how it was okay if he wanted to go. He could no longer talk, but was able to nod and respond to what we were saying. 

Surrounded by love, his family, and his favorite nurses, Jon passed away at 7:30pm, April 8, 2006. 

Memorial Services will be held on April 17, 2006, at the Alameda Funeral Home (12341 S. Saratoga-Sunnyvale Rd, Saratoga CA) at 10AM. Visitation will be held on Sunday the 16th, from 1pm to 5pm.

Jon, I love you, and I miss you, and I'll keep you in my thoughts forever.

BODY:
well sorry that it's been so long since i've updated. to be honest, i couldn't even log into this website because of some error with the host. needless to say, that i'm back and reading to point out random encounters in my day, and hopefully get a laugh or two, even at my own expense : ).

here are a few good reads (short stories) recommended by my friend ryan:

<a href ="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/faith/questions/leap.html">leap</a>
<a href="http://ofsink.com/bullet.pdf">bullet in the brain</a>
<a href="http://www.classicshorts.com/stories/lotry.html">the lottery</a>

since my mp3 player died on me last february, i've been reading a lot of books in my spare time. so far the list is at:

1. shogun
2. the alchemist (highly recommended)
3. sputnik sweetherat

works in progress:

1. when we were orphans
2. south of the border, west of the sun

unfortunately though, work is starting up again, and my free time to read is slowly diminishing to train rides and bus rides. hopefully it'll also keep my english level up to a comprehendable level.

BODY:
what's been happening you guys? i woke up this morning and thought to myself <em>what the hell would i do if an earthquake struck here?</em> i mean everything in japan is made of ricepaper in concrete, doubt anything could really save me from being crushed :P.

so then i asked one of my jte's...

me: so what should i do? there's nothing to duck under at home.
fukushima sensei: well you can um...
m: /waits.
f: well, hmmm...
m: /waits.
f: just do as we japanese do.
m: and that is?
f: scream.
m: ...

awesome.

so as you also might not know, we just finished what the japanese call `golden week.` what is golden week? it's where a string of emperor's had their birthdays and, thus, they translate into days off for the rest of japan. this also happens to coincide with the busiest, and most expensive, traveling season in japan.

but at least (for this year) it's 3 days off in the week plus a weekend.

ryan, kristy, and i headed off to kamakura (pics up soon) where we got to see the various temples, and, shock, no conbinis! not to mention the world's largest buddha and some other tranquil scenes - like the temple that has a paved parkinglot. makes me wonder if the entrance fees really go towards upkeep... hey why's there a new whirpool for the monks....?

afterwards, ryand and i soloed to tokyo where we headed for shibuya. originally we wanted to go to nikko, but train times, and the lack of a plan lead us to settle for a trip to tokyo. don't get me wrong, it was still fun as hell. we grabbed dinner at this all-you-can-eat indian restaurant, where it wasn't bad, but what can you expect with all-you-can-eat in tokyo?

after a bit of a frustrating search, we secured our lodgings at one of those infamous capsule hotels. to appease our concerns, we noticed that the outside of it was covered in marble.

any hotel that's covered in marble has to be good... right?

...right?

we also got to see the world's most profitable starbucks, that also overlooks the world's busiest intersection (shibuya). that was pretty cool. we also visited ueno park, ameyo market, asakusa, and shinjuku as well. all in all, it was good times.

even though we had a long weekend, it never feels like it's enough. as my friend says:

averagesmartguy: i need a vacation from golden week :/.

amen.

BODY:
so i finished:

1. when we were orphans.
2. south of the border, west of the sun.
3. hardboiled wonderland and the end of the world.

and for the most part, they were good reads. but now i have no books to read, so train rides are rather boring... but i did do something i never thought i'd do.

i bought an iPod nano. white, 2gb. not sure if many of you know, but my sandisk (damn it mike!) died on me in february (which spurred the reading) and i've been procrastinating long enough to not buy the ipod just cause i didn't want to conform. but, i figured i have a powerbook, and winamp tags are lame, and they had a sale on golden week where they dropped the price by about 20 bucks, i thought <em>sure, why not?</em>. 175 dollars later, i am the proud owner of an ipod nano. and then as i wasn't paying attention, the clerk drops it on the floor. awesome eh?

i still haven't opened it yet though.

not much has really been going on in my life; school's been keeping me pretty busy. some fun quotes that probably won't make sense to you guys, but for my own amusement would be:

`and then there's a big fat bush,` from susie, and
`i like you, you're a lot like me. except not an ass hole,` care of scott drunk hehe.

we celebrated brad's birthday awhiles back ago (4/29) which was good times, i have pics, but just haven't put them up. this will inevitably lead me to do something else i thought i'd never do.

upgrade my flickr account to pro for unlimited uploads, and a few other minor goodies.

nothing incredibly major, but just these little developments in my life. so let's see... school's going well. my new kids are really great - minus the one i threw a pen cap at, for good reason might i add you - and i swear it was just a light throw to get her attention... anyways, i find that sometimes lessons are a bit draining on the energy levels and when i get home i just want to cook dinner (or order pizza :D) and play games till i pass out. for the most part it feels like weekends aren't long enough, and though try as i might, you can't belp but notice that the first year is almost over, with a little more than 2 months to go.

where has all the time gone?

and though i did say that i wanted to come home in august, it looks like even that might be rather difficult to some extent. i have to teach till the end of july (roughly) and the new jets come in around august time (and i'd like to help them out) in addition we start classes again in september (fun times). if anything i might come back home in december, but to be honest, a trip to taiwan (again) would be nice i think. not too sure what's going on.

some thoughts on the horizon. this saturday i'm off to tokyo to go watch some sumo wrestling with susie (we're in japan right?) and the weekend after, sato sensei (she sounds like a flower), was engaged last march or so and getting married. and i have an invitation for her wedding reception saturday the 27th. brad, ryan, and i are also planning to stay in a japanese style in sometim in may/june, and possibly a trip to kyoto/osaka/nara/hiroshima in july (it'll be hot... and humid... and sweltering... did i mention humid?).

oh yeah and i'm going to meet itou sensei (my ucsd japanese teacher) in nagoya this june :)

i sometimes wonder how much i've changed. i've noticed whenever i leave japan, i still find myself doing all the japanese manuerisms; the bowing, the excessive politeness, and even speaking in japanese. it's somewhat scary. i wonder how much of myself i'll actually have retained at the end of another year, and how much of my self has changed for the better/worse and what you guys will think of me when you see me again.

i think i'm still the same guy ; )

and on some random notes, qq has filled my mind again (and i think only a few people will get that), i've started writing some random stream of consciousnesses, and i guess to address a question some of you are wondering:

how's japan?
japan is good, if some things changed, it'd be even better.

am i having fun?
absolutely.

soo, what's been going on lately?

not an incredibly large amount to be honest. though i got, quite possibly, the funniest email from my dentist's office that i've seen in a long time. as you all know, my dad (i still love my dad haha) has a rather big mouth and likes to brag/talk/whatever. usually i think to draw attention to him (which i notice i do as well :[) but for the most part, my dad is infinitely better than i am at it.

for example.

he walks into the dentist's office recently, and, yells to everyone `my son is looking for a girl friend!!!`

for the record, i have not, nor will ever, announce something like that to my dad... so my blame lies somewhere bewteen my family, friends, and oscar, the cat.

needless to say, this got a rather impressive reaction. within (i presume) minutes i receive an email from my dental office with a rather peculiar announcement:

`We found the girl for you to marry and make your Mom and Dad very proud`

uh... huh. at first i thought, <em>well hey, maybe there was this nice girl that came to get her teeth cleaned. coincidentally her father was with her as well and they started talking about how she's searching for this awesome-tall-asian-who-might-possibly-be-living-in-japan-but-will-come-home-soon kind of guy.</em> hey, it could happen.

then i snapped back to reality and realized... i don't really talk about girls i like with my dentist...

and that's when i scrolled down the email and found <a href=http://japancupid.com/Member_Profile.cfm?ID=83579&First_Name=Kelly">this</a>

yeaop. i have, no, comment.

but ok let's me honest, why is someone who lives in macau posting in `japancupid?` :P

alright, besides that, the title of this post is in reference to what i did last saturday with susie. we made our way to tokyo to watch the (there are many apparently) sumo tournaments. we also spent part of the day in asakusa (again for me, well her too), tokyo, and shinjuku. anyways, we get in, and it's a lot like, well sumo is a lot like a bunch of fat guys in loin cloths and salt.

don't get me wrong, very cultural, very respected in japan. i mean shit, we have wrestling ;P tight leather undies, or loin cloths and salt? i'd prefer neither to be honest.

to make it even better, i decided that a beer would be nice, and susie agreed. however, i downed it rather fast, and ended up passing out for about half an hour of the 90 minutes we were there... it was heaps fun though heh.

did i mention i paid about fifty bucks for a 30 minute nap and 60 minutes of fat guys in loincloths slapping each other and throwing salt?

go me!

well it is. can anyone else believe i'm starting the 11th month? cause i sure can't.

so what's been happening lately? i, can't say that i remember everything, but a few notables:

last wednesday susie and i went out for 100yen (about a buck) sushi and ran into susie's student who was working there. and lo and behold, we got the hookup! no joke, first time ever in japan heh. i had 14 plates, he charged me 10, and she had 6, he charged her 3. simply, awesome.

i went to a japanaese wedding reception party on saturday the 27th where i found my self (for the second time) in a situation without any native english speakers. it was pretty cool for the most part, met three really nice japanese people who want to go bowling with me sometime soon (i need to email them). well the person's who wedding it was was sato sensei (i guess now, kato sensei, but old habits die hard eh?). and don't ask me how it ended up at this, but i found myself singing `with or without` you for them ;P

and it's REALLY weird when you have about 30 japanese people looking at you with this face: o.Oa.

afterwards, headed to watch `the davinci code` with brad and ryan where, in my honest opinion (no spoilers) wondered what some of those who haven't read the book felt. because it seemed that there were a lot of parts where if you didn't read the book, it would just seem incredibly disjoint. and did anyone else wonder why tom hanks is robert langdon?

i swear anybody could have fit the bill for that character.

i wasn't a big fan of it in the beginning, since mnost of it was brown's narration, and thus, hard to translate to the silver screen. but as the story picked up, i found myself enjoying it more and ian mckellan with the two lines that got me to laugh out loud - and as usual, brad, ryan, and me were the only 3 laughing heh.

mmm other thoughts...

i've started going to the gym again (only took 10 months XD) and it feels really good. i have yet to open the iPod nano i bought, and am contemplating getting  shuffle for the gym and for running. anyone else think this is a bad idea?

also about coming home. i originally thought of coming home after the one year mark (7/31) to restock on some us supplies - gel, deodorant, toothpaste, etc. but find it less and less likely to make a trip back home. and if i did, it'd be only one time; in the summer or the winter for 1 week or so. to be honest though i'm thinking i won't be back home till august 2007 and might just run to taiwan for winter break or maybe thailand /shrug.

gotta take advantage of being halfway around the world right?

zomg i learned how to use those electric paddles that paramedics and doctors use to resuscitate those who have no heartbeat.

and for some reason i feel i am even more of a danger to those in japan than ever before... why might i think that? well let's just say the day went something like this:

trained paramedic: alright so now i'm going to show you how to use the AED.
me and the other 19 teachers there: /nod.
tp: so the one thing that you CANNOT DO, that you ABSOLUTELY SHOULD NOT DO because it MIGHT kill someone is asdfj;aldskjfklsvnaweicmwpoemvpwdlf (it might as well have come out like that cause that's about as much as i caught of it)!!!
m: ...
senseis: oh yes yes, you shouldn't do that that's very dangerous.
m: um, can someone explain that in simpler japanese or english?

      no response.

m: fantastic (in english).

fun times eh? 3 hrs of it too. <3 my crap japanese abilities.

BODY:
really busy the last week. so where to begin?

last sunday night i went up to tokyo early (first solo trip) and met up with my dad's sister's husband's sister... don't think too hard on it, but by chinese standards, we're related. no really.

but anyways the reason for this is because from monday to wednesday i had to go to the clair recontracting orientation for, well, for recontracting jets. for the most part it was pretty cool to hang out with friends i haven't seen in awhile and going out for dinner in tokyo is always fun - though tokyo isn't exactly cheap. still fun though. met up with masaya (brad and ryan's friend who went snowboarding with us in nagano, and let us crash at his place) and his senpai and his senpai's wife and even met up with some new people. for the most part, i'll say that it's good to see old friends, meet new ones, and still (even though i disagree that it takes 6 hrs of orientation to accomplish, but it's an excuse to be in tokyo for three days) be reminded that even though we're alone in our schools, we're not alone, well not entirely.

and `no` that wasn't ment to sound cheesy.

honest.

though i think the highlight of my trip was sitting there on the third day, during the final seminar held by the ministry of education and i looked towards my left at what aga was doing:

me thinking: man this is boring. aga seems to be writing a lot on her pamphlet. /takesapeek.
aga continues drawing.
mt: hey that looks a lot like...
mt: ...
mt: .../lookscloser.
mt: ...
mt: yeaop that'd be godzilla attacking tokyo tower... with me riding on top of his head... fantastic.

this is when she saw the reaction on my face, and bursted out laughing in the midst of dead silence. :D

but yeah, coming home was rathering tiring, and four classes in a row is never fun the next day...

so that brings us to last weekend... on friday night i finally meet up with lawrence and sofia for the first time in a long time - i cooked dinner for them - and had a good chat with a few beers and a bottle of wine (knowing me, i didn't drink much). and knowing me, i passed out rather promptly. and knowing me, woke up, showered, and woke up around noon the next day... fun times!

but that night is where i learned this phrase:

'tight as a ducks ass'

and what does it mean exactly? it means you're a penny pincher!! and apparently that pennys come out of your ass... ass pennys... hmmm...

oh yeah, saturday lawrence, sofia, kyoko, masahiro, and doug came out to drag (more or less) me off towards the festival in the city i was in. not too sure what it was for, i'd imagine something in relation to bars and hostess bars, but perhaps i'm wrong :o. anyways got to eat some beef kabobs, baked potatoes, and (i couldn't resist) garlic flavored french fries. 

good freaking times :)

on a random note, anyone else feel like spending japanese money is a lot like monopoly money?

It doesn't seem like monopoly money to me cos it uses so damned many <i>coins</i>.  And the third lowest bill is the equivalent of a Benjamin?  I dunno; that still hurts my head.

brad, ryan, and i went to nikko for this weekend and stayed at a really nice <a href="http://www.nikko-jp.org/kyoiku/k_hotel/fuwali.html">ryoukan</a> or japanese style in. it was pretty cool really, two meals, japanese styled rooms, and a mini hot springs for about 160 for one night. now i know that's not exactly the cheapest in the world, but remember, this is japan.

anyways, we got to visit some really nice temples, shrines, a lake and two really spectacular waterfalls, and without a doubt i know my post doesn't do it justice, but i'll have picks up soon.

yes i know i also owe you guys picks from goldenweek in kamakura and the next trips on the agenda are nagoya and okinawa and possibly hong kong and china... seems like a bit much, but we'll see.

wish me luck!

about living at home:

anon: i swear, if my sister was a roommate and not a sibling
a: i'd be looking to move out
a: -_-
me: LOL
m: i need to quote that
m: and make it anonymous
a: ROFL

<3 family.

small world:

last night i ordered a pizza for dinner (no groceries in the kitchen :O) and the pizza guy who delivered was actually a student who graduated from my school last year and is attending a college in fuji/fujinomiya and working part time at my favorite take out place... not bad eh?

another example is that ryan, who lives in the apt below susie trained in kung fu with marc (college roommate).

ball, GAMMME!!

just came back from my school's baseball game, which went 0-6 in the first four innings... and scoreless in the fifth, but in the top of the sixth, we had bases loaded, one out, and managed to make it 2-6 with the tying runner at bat.

sadly in the end, and the end means 7 innings, we lost 2-9, but gave a valient effort! it was just really cool to see my school get together and cheer together with a pretty strong spirit.

and then of course there's me.

screaming my lungs off, and trying to motivate my kids to cheer harder! and as i type this, i think i lost my voice haha.

anyways, got a few good pictures, tired, and will keep you guys updated soon.

well i know it's a bit late, but i figured i'd update you all with some nagoya antics. in case you guys aren't aware of it, on the 8th of this month i made my first solo trip to nagoya to visit my japanese teacher, itou sensei, from ucsd. it was something we had planned a year ago when i was first app-ing towards jet and she wrote me a letter of rec.

she helped me probably more than anybody (except for bill clauby) in preparation for jet, and also encouraged me throughout the application process till i finally got to tell her that i got in.

that, and she put up with my stupid japanese questions during her office hours.

and there were a lot of those times.

sorry sensei ^^;;.

so anyways, we get there without a hitch, and visited places like nagoya castle, a famous temple (which we didn't go inside... cause none of us wanted to hahaha), a famous shopping district, nagoya tower, etc.

nothing really happened till we had lunch that first day, in which we entered a shopping mall in hopes to find a restaurant. unfortunately as we wandered around we couldn't find a directory for each floor, so i suggested the elevator. and as we step into the elevator...

itou sensei: um, there aren't any restaurants here chu-san.
me: mmm /presses third floor.
i: why'd you do that?
m: to stop us, because if we pressed 2, we should have taken the stairs.
i: no i meant... /door opens.
elevator attendant: third floor, womans lingerie, womans clothing.

/everyoneintheelevatorlooksatme.

i: ...that.
m: ...

and then when we were sitting around in nagoya castle:

m: you remember when you taught me a way to say ざんねん, but told me it was only use for a series of unfortunate events?
i: yeaop.
m: but you told me i should use a nother one that meant only one bad thing has happened to you...
i: let me see...

/5seconds

i: shimata!!! (haha, this is like saying `OH SHIT!!!`)
m: no... not quite...

and, for the moment, when we went to the aquarium in nagoya... that cost 20 bucks to get in:

m: wow this is really nice!
i: yes... but is it 20 dollars nice?
m: ...

and

m: we should sit here and enjoy the view for awhile neh?
i: yeah, let's try for 20 dollars worth.
m: ...

haha fun times :D

the owner had two of her (grand?)children there and they started asking me why i was so tall, and their introduction was something along the lines of the little brother saying (not looking at me btw) `i'm... i'm... [crapforgothisname]` and the older brother said `MY NAME IS [crapforgothisnametoo]!`

so it's summer vacation again (as of two days ago) and nothing much going on. i finished bono's book, `bono on bono,` and am reading `the tipping point.` also started working on an art project, though i probably should have thought more on my subject though...

i'm drawing the flag raising at iwojima.

good night everybody!

but anyways, i have a student of mine, 三年生, going to australia for a home-stay (and for the love of crap i can't think of what we call that in english). anyways, she's asking me to help her with her english, which i'm all up for doing, and i'm just trying to teach her a few set phrases to work with when she's abroad and a few manners to be aware of that western/english speaking countries do differently than japanese.

anyways, today i gave her 5 set phrases, and asked her to write 3 examples in japanese and then we'd translate them together into english. her friend (also one of my students last year, rika, came to listen cause she had to do some make-up work) so we were doing ~,でも~ and...:

me: じゃ、次。
naomi: りかはきれいじゃない、でも私はきれい。。。
rika: 死ね！！！！！

in a nut shell:

me: alright, next.
naomi: rika isn't pretty, but i a...
rika: DIE!!!

hmm, i guess you had to be there. imagine this cute little girl, with all the rage in the world (a split after we all registered what naomi said) just yells out DIEEEEEEEEE!!!!

i knew you'd all get it ^^.

or not ;P

i think last night was possibly one of the hardest moments i've had in jet.

i had to say goodbye to susie.

she's boarding a plane as i write this, and i can't help but feel a part of me is gone with her. i mean saying `goodbye` to my friends back home is not as hard, because i know i'll see them again when i go home. and to that extent it's made this one far more difficult then i ever could have imagined.

let alone, i'm horrible at coming up with the right words to express myself.

and to be honest, i don't know when the next time i'll see her again is. and that truly does leave me rather hollow inside.

the list of things that we have been through and the things that we've seen in the last year of time seem like they're from another lifetime. from hokkaido to taiwan and back again, from cooking at my place to eating out at the local shops that we've become so fond of. and it all came flooding back to me as i rode the bus to work today to the lyrics `...and afterall, you're my wonderwall.`

susie, i don't know if you'll ever read this, but i don't think you really understand the extent to which you've made the last year incredibly enjoyable for me.

even if it sometimes involved a glass (or two, or three...) of wine.

and the truly sad thing is that it probably won't hit me until i catch myself pulling up to your apartment on my bike, and realizing that no one is home...

i hope that you find what you're looking for, and occasionally remember this fool who's stuck in japan and send him the occasional email inquiring how this fool is doing. and remember that one day we will meet again, in another time, another place.

i can only hope that it's sooner than we think it will be.

Geh, heavy stuff.  I feel with ya.  Obviously I wasn't privy to all those experiences, but in my own way I know what you're dealing with - I had the same thing happen when my buddy (the other Ohma ALT) left.

At least you got to have a planned goodbye date though.  My bud showed up at the high school one morning to tell me 'bye, thanks, etc.  After a handshake, he was gone.  :\

On the plus side, the internet is a really wonderful thing for keeping in touch with people if you're serious about it, or even if you just decide some years down the road to try sending someone an e-mail.  Whenever I send/receive an e-mail from my bud it seems like he's just down the street again, which is a nice feeling.  Also, give yourself about a month.  All the business that'll be going on what with the newbs arriving and all will help refocus your mind to happier places, too, so you got something to look forward to.

And, if you wanna talk, send me an IM and I'll open up Skype.  I'm usually free most nights.  Take care man.  *hugs*

so it's finally come full circle.

at least the first year anyways. and i made it! i know i'm really bad with pictures, and keeping in touch, and not coming home, but it was something that i had to prove to myself and see if i could come out on top, or be swept beneath gasping for salvation.

all i can say is that the view from where i am right now (my desk at school) is amazing. haha, well you get the idea.

no i'm not gasping for salvation.

in this last year in japan i've done so much, seen so much, and experienced an unbeliveable amount. from sapporo to tokyo to osaka, to indonesia, singapore, taiwan, and thailand. i've met amazing japanese people who try so hard to internationalize themselves with outside culture and appreciate the effort that foreigners, like myself, try to do the same in japan. i've also met stubborn minds that refuse to give and compromise only to give birth to minor conflicts and unecessary bouts.

but that's to be expected. that's life, ups and downs.

i've come from 0 experience in teaching to 0.012 experience in teaching. well ok, it's been interesting to say the least, and it definitely didn't start off well. but i learned, i adapted, and it still doesn't start off well. haha no i'm only kidding. my kids are wonderful.

especially with those who find enjoyment in conversing with me in english:

example 1:
maki: yo!
me: sup!
ma: not much!
me and ma: yosh!

example 2 (this isn't really a conversation, but it makes me laugh):
yuki: hospital!

example 3:
hiroyo: give me chocolate and money!
m: ばかやろ！！！！

even in the never ending questions of me and my girlfriends... even if they are asked an hour apart, and even if i have said the same thing each time `no.` i can't help but smile each time.

so what does all of this mean to you (and i just mean travis, cause he's the only one reading this) back home?

are there good things in japan? of course. can certain things be improved? always. am i having fun? absolutely.

come on year two, i'm ready for you.

BODY:
wow has it been awhile. so much has happened and only recently have i had a shot to catch my breath about it all. so let's get started:

thailand was so much fun; i think the highlight of the trip is that i can say i've been to bangkok, phuket, and pipi.

and perhaps nothing more needs to be said about that trip haha.

honestly though, it was a great final trip for ryan, brad, and me before brad headed home. just a chance to relax on the beach, go scuba diving for the first time, and learn that fish really like bread for some reason...

bangkok was even more ridiculous. we met up with ishya's (sister inlaw) aunt, pa jim, who showed us all around bangkok in about 36 hours. absolutely a whirlwind of epic proportions. the three of us agreed that she should start a tour company called `the bangkok quickie` haha.

some highlights of the trip were:

i think this was in phuket:
ryan: yeah that's totally frustrating, just like unrequited love.
brad and me: ...
r: isn't that right ryan?
r: that's right ryan.
r: ...yeah...

we're trying to parallel park, but the spot was too small:
pa jim: ok brad, go out and push.
brad: what?
p: push that car backwards.
brad, me, ryan: what?!!
p: fine, i'll do it myself!
p: /getsoutofthecarandpushestheothercar.
b,m,r: ...

ah good times.

a few days later brad had to head back to the states because his 3 year contract was up with jet. brad's seriously been one of my best friends like ryan and susie. it was pretty hard to say goodbye, but as ryan put it to me, it doesn't really feel like we said goodbye. almost as if next monday we'll meet again at chukate and everything will be back to normal.

thank you for everything brad.

and finally the new alts have finally come into town. i've spent the last four days showing them around and trying to help them settle into their new surroundings in the fuji city area. for the most part they're a pretty cool bunch with good attitudes and high spirits.

we'll see after a few months.

haha nah i'm just kidding. sort of...

oh yeah and aeon (my second cous) came down for a few days and we headed up to a fire festival in fujinomiya on saturday with the new alts. ok so the way it works is you have this float, an it has 3 long parallel wooden beams, and set in the middle is this wooden plank with a cauldren on top. in the cauldren is a barn fire with 4-6 japanese women standing around it while a bunch of guys hoist them up on their shoulders (with the 3 wooden beams).

anyways, tomoko finds one that she called `the gangster float` cause all the guys were drunk and had tatoos. they started talking to me:

gangster1: so where you from?
me: america
g2: you like japan?!
m: ... of course!
g2: thank you!
m: you like america?
g1 and g2: yes we do!
me and drunken japanese guys: yosh!!!

etc. etc. but then i asked if i could help, and the guy takes off his jacket, and said `present present!` so in a nut shell, jake and i got free jackets that say 頭火会 on the back, or `head fire group` and we got to hoist up the float with everyone, which was pretty crazy to say the least. the next day though, aeon had to take off, and i promised i'd find my way up to niigata one of these days...

and that should bring you all up to speed heh.

ok, two really weird things just happened to me today. ok, well yesterday, but it's 3 am and i can't sleep cause it's about 85 degrees in my room + humidity. yes i have ac, and i only started using it. it's making me sleepy to be honest.

ok so first.

today i rode my bike to school for the first time. and for the most part it was uneventful but it proved that it's not as bad as i thought it was. so anyways, i get into school and i leave my sandals on the floor near my cubby and switch to my 'indoor' sandals. 'indoor' meaning i needed bigger sandals, couldn't find them in japan, and thus turned my really outdoor sandals into 'indoor' sandals. shh, don't tell anyone!

regardless, i didn't get a chance to make an obento for myself because i ate out last night, so i found myself getting ready to bike to the local conbini to find some perishables. except when i get to where i left my sandals, they aren't there. i looked through every cubby near mines and still no sandals. then i went to the school office and asked if they took my sandals. they came over and, once again,  we looked through all the cubbies near mine and still nothing.

i didn't have the heart to tell them i already did that, but they seemed so into it ;P.

so we were all sitting around and trying to think of what ill twisted fate might have befallen my sandals when one of the school office members walks towards the door.

school employee: (this is in japanese btw) now, can you describe your sandals?
me: yeah, they look like the ones i'm wearing now, but with a toe tihng. black and kind of worn down on the soles.
s: hmm could they be these?
m: omg yes!
school employees: hahahahahahahahahahaha.
m: ....

they were in the trash can.

now this is the other weird thing that happened to me yesterday.

lately i've been trying to find a trip to hk to visit a good friend of mines from uni. my obasan /cough. anyways, i'm calling around, trying to find the cheapest prices for flights and what not, and so far to no avail. after calling 5 agencies, i come across hit travel. please note this conversation was not edited in anyway that would change what transpired (this went on for at least 20 minutes):

me: hi, is english ok?
hit travel guy: yes! how can i help you?
m: i'm looking for a trip to hk on the 15th-18th in september. i saw you have a promotion for 25ooo yen.
h: yes we do, one second please.
m: k.
h: i'm sorry it's full.
m: oh, ok, well can you tell me the cheapest fare for those dates please?
h: yes. so what're you doing in japan anyways?
m: oh i'm an english teacher.
h: oh wow, that's so cool. i want to speak english, i practice english everyday. but if i studied english in japan i don't want to do it with your program or any other program. btw what program do you do it with?
m: jet.
h: oh you mean the rock band from australia? anyways i'd rather do it somewhere like new york, or london, or los angeles cause it's so much better than studying. and speaking nof which, what the heck is with japanese girls going to these areas and picking up any boy they want? am i right or am i right? they go somwhere and all of a sudden have 49 (not joking, he said all of this) boyfriends waiting for him. and me? i go, and nothing. absolutely nothing. but my english is good right? right? anyways one thing we do have an advantage with is romanian and russian chicks. they love us to bits and are so easy. in fact they're not even that expensive. am i right, or am i right? but why can't we go around getting the girls in london or new york or los angeles? what's the big deal? i'm a fairly attractive guy and i think i speak english very well. can you believe i've never been to any english speaking country or done anything like aeon or nova (competing teaching programs). isn't my english wonderful? of course it's wonderful because the japanese level of english sucks (no argument here). anyways what level of school do you teach?
m: um... high school?
h: omg high school girls are so nice to look at aren't they. i mean they're so young and, oh hey, so can you speak japanese?
m: a little...
h: you should do this in japanese! you're in japan, and you should practice, your japanese is probably terrible, but you need to try. that's what's important, trying, just like i try my english with you. in fact it's probably good that we're doing this conversation in english and that i get to practice more. probably better than your japanese. anyways let's try this in japanese...

i must go now...

last night the newbies and i went to go (ok well it was more me) to a sukiyaki restaurant that i've seen around town. so the newbies and i, in flip flops and shorts wandered into this restaurant that looked pretty high class; nice tables, chairs, marble floors, antiques displayed etc...

aine: hey, jeff, this um, aren't we a bit underdressed for this?
me: nah, this is a country that you can drink a beer anywhere at anytime and no one would care.
a: gotcha.
m: heh, it's not like you're going to pay 4ooo yen for this meal hahahahaha.
aine+jake+emily: hahahahahaha

/opensthemenu.

one setting at this restaurant: 3,675 yen per person.

daily dose of irony by chance: priceless.
for everything else, there's mastercard.

then i call the waitress over and try to get a better explanation. maybe it's a set meal for 4 people for 4ooo yen. maybe.

m: excuse me, um, can you clarify if this means for one person or one set?
waitress: well it's per person and - unknown japanese - is that ok?
m: ah... sorry i'm not japanese
w: yeah i got that.
m: ...

ouch :\

...it's still summer... BUT not without a few summer antics :D

for example:

i had a few kids who were getting ready to go home after practicing basketball. and as usual as i walk by everyone starts laughing at me - still not sure if this is a good thing or bad - but regardless something that always interests my kids is if i can remember their name or not... and it's usually not. and if it is, there's always that one student whose name i can't remember for the life of me (they're not the real participating kind, or their not the real annoying kind). so in front of me are two students, behind them is a student at her locker, and behind her is one student sitting down and another talking to the one sitting down.

and then it starts with the short little loud one who comes out of nowhere and says:

unknown: sensei sensei, what's my name?
me: um...
u: /frustrated, ok ok well what's her name (points to one of the two in front of me)
m: haruka.
u: and hers? (points to the other one)
m: azu
u: and her? (the girl sitting down just smiling at me)
m: saki
u: and her? (the girl talking to saki)
m: miki.
u: and me??!!!
m: ...

i tried i really did.

u: ... I'M MIKI!!! why can't you remember my name but everyone elses?!!!
haruka: it's cause you're futoi (foo - toy)*.
everyone: hahahahahaha

*it means chunky...

me: wow you ate that really fast.
goto sensei: yes, because i tired.
m: ah i hear ya.
g: yes because it's wednesday.
m: oh?
g: yes, because it is middle of week.
m: aye that's tough.
g: friday is best!
m: yeah, but which is worse though, sunday or monday?
g: hmmm.
m: sunday is bad because we have to work tomorrow, but there is no school.
g: and monday is blue day.
m: aye. sunday to thursday is bad neh, friday and saturday are best!
g: yes, sunday is worst, then monday, thursday is ok, but today i am tired and hungry.
m: /patpat

about five seconds of silence elapse.

g: because it's wednesday.

goto sensei and i teach a business english class. to be honest i really like goto sensei, but i have no idea what to teach in business english. and of course it doesn't help that he leaves the entire cirriculum design to me...

so anyways first day back in class was yesterday and he wanted to sell this `language village` program (when he says it it sounds like `langugae bridge`) that he attended for a few days in august. he tells me that he's prepared a report for the kids except his report turns out to be itinerary for the three days he was there.

keep in mind i'm in the back of the class room playing freecell and he's been going on for about 45 minutes on his schedule for said three days:

goto: so today was good day. breakfast 9;00 - 9;30, then private lesson all day, and then we have dinner 6:00 - 7:00. then next is best time, because you can have cigarette and break and drink coffee. it was very good coffee.

10 seconds of silence elapse.

g: might be coloumbian...

hahaha.

so my thursday schedule goes something like this:

1st period: nothing
2nd period: oc1
3rd period: nothing
4th period: oc1
5th period: business english
6th period: oc1

and because of sports testing, lunch has been moved from between 4th and 5th to 3rd and 4th.

which means i get a fantastic 3 classes in a row.

awesome.

so here i am, psyching myself up for 3 continuous hours of genkiness as i walk into the english room.

me: so hara sensei, the other teachers and i have found that the best way to do this activity is with a `repeat after me` and then a quick overview of the definitions of the new vocabulary. in addition after we finish that we'll be able to get the first example off on the next activity and then the bell should ring.
hara sensei: sounds great... for tomorrow.
m: thank yo... wait what?
h: oh, because it's sports testing today, there are no first year classes... didn't you get the memo? (he didn't say this, but can't you just see that line there?)
m: ...

but i filed my tps reports...

so in my 1-1 homeroom on thursdays, i have two students with the same name, mao. and of course as i call roll each morning for that class i always end up with two name tags in my hands, and shitty enough for me, it's the two maos.

mao yasue
mao narita

oh what to do?

so after about two weeks or so they started getting peaved that i couldn't remember which one was which (i mean come on... they're both mao so i can't really get that wrong right...?) so they suggested i started calling them by their family names, or 名字（みょうじ）.

so this thursday morning i decided to try the family name thing.

except old habits die hard...

and i called her narita空港...

and then she comes up to me after class

and says...

`...not airport.`

BODY:
so on 9/24, a day after tokyo game show (another entry coming on that), after receiving a thoroughly distraught (just kidding rinnie <3) phonecall from linda aka rinnie from kyoto, i headed home unexpectedly and found myself on a shink to kyoto at 8:30 am.

and this doesn't sound like much to you. but think of it like spending two days in sf, and then all of a sudden driving to la for a day trip.

yeah, crazy, neh?

so we ended up heading down to nara (they <em>say</em> it's better than kyoto...).

they also say things like eating shrimp brains is good.

well they do.

anyways. nara is FILLED with deer. needless to say i think it's not better than kyoto; kyoto doesn't smell like deer poop. period. but as the story goes, you're supposed to be able to do nara in a day (not two minutes like other things...). and there are shrines / temples /  pagodas galor. thankfully traveling with rinnie is incredibly easy:

me: hey, /looksatmap, does this look worth it?
rinda: nah, it doesn't
m: alright let's get the f out of here
r: first time here though right?
m: yeaop
r: yeah me too, glad it's settled

saving money is good. really. then there was this pillar that has a small tunnel gauged at the base of it (big enough for a child). i told linda i was going to try to get in myself and she waited on the otherside. this is what happened:

some japanese guy: are you korean??!
seth (cool foreigner): is he your friend?
linda: no... yes :P
s: what're you doing here?
l: i wanna see if he[me] can make it through
s: us too... that's the only reason why we're here really.
hana (seth's wife): if he can do it, will you try seth?
s: probably not
l: ...
me: /stuck

and on the way home cause we ended up not eating lunch:

me: hey, you know, i really like tsukune... but no idea what it is... do you?
l: it's probably deer....
m: ...

well at least it's not deer poo...

and then when we got into kyoto for dinner, you get a great view of kyoto tower:

m: omg that is so not a phallus!
l: ewww what are you talking about?
m: well look at it!
l: it's a long tall thin rod with a...
m: exactly!
l: ok, well if that's a phallus, then so is the eiffel tower
m: yeaop, and the washington monument
l: and obolisks!
m: and tokyo tower
l: and the statue of liberty
m: yea... wait a minute.

well it was a gift from the french...

who i don't teach... but for some reason they feel they need to extend their salutations to me.

so as i walk down the halls at work, i just hear `HI JOFU!`

...

and then i tell them they're wrong.

and they stare a little bewildered and respond:

`HI... joFU?!` and they looked very proud that they had gotten it right.

THAT'S THE SAME THING YOU IDIOTS!

...

at least get the `je` part right! fcukers.

that aren't so missing... i've just been lazy to add them in here...

what?

so the first. on the 15th of last month, ryan and i made our way to hk, and a BIG BIG BIG thank you to ames for meeting us there and showing us around. even when she was dead tired... much <3 <3 <3.

needless to say, it was great to get real chinese food in the belly and, cause ames is so cool (/cough), it was good to see her as well.

after ames left us on sunday afternoon (flying back to the states), we hitted up macau for some good ol black jack. as you all know they've recently opened up two vegas-like casinos owned by two vegas hotel companies.

i think the best was when we had to get from the fairy terminal to the central part of macau...

we were offered tours for 150 us, which after much debate it was brought down to 80... and in the end

we just took one of the casino shuttles for free :P.

...

`why yes, of course we're guests at the [insert hotel name]. baggage? um... we travel light? like...  just the clothes on our backs?`

yeah... something like that.

oh and they were 15 dollar hands... and apparently bacarat is very popular in asia.

his name... number two.

went to tokyo game show on saturday the 23rd of last month, and it was pretty awesome. for those of you who don't know much about it, it's like e3 but for japan. in the end i think it was just pretty cool to be there you know? got to check out the new games coming out for all three systems, things that every company is working on and so forth.

and the best part about it, is that it was only 1ooo yen per person (about 9 bucks).

BODY:
so we didn't go to korea. and here's what happened:

ryan and i ducked out of work around 11:30 am and made our way to tokyo. at which, we were supposed to transfer to one of three options to get to narita airport. apon arriving in tokyo around 2:30 we alight at shinagawa to make our way to nippori to ride the keisei ltd express to the airport. getting into nippori, and trying to buy tickets, we learn that the keisei had an accident and is thus, shut down. with less than an hour to go, we find out options slim and head down to tokyo station. at tokyo station, the other two remaining options reveal themselves: the sobu line, which is delayed due to rain and not running at a time we need, and the narita express, the most expensive of all the trains that we were hoping to avoid (about 30 dollars).

with no hope but to get on the sobu or the keisei, we jump aboard the narita exp, standing for about 55 min, at least that's what's advertised. around 30 minutes into the trip, it stops, and something about being at a traffic light (on a train??). no clue how long we were there, but i do know that we were supposed to get in at 4:28, we got in at 5:12.

we arrive to find narita packed to the brim with many angry travelers, to which we soon discovered their angst; 99% of all flights have been put on indefinite (what the hell does that mean?) or cancelled.

at least cancelled flights knew there was no hope of finding a way out of japan for the night.

so checking in to our flight, ryan and i bounce around the airport restaurants (spending about 30 dollars on food and drink, cause, we might as well be full) till about 8:10 at night, checking periodically if our flight status has been updated. and surprise surprise.

nothing.

but i did have chicken nuggets for the first time in 14 months.

and they were delicious.

so now we're looking for a northwest official to ask some questions, and what we find are a lot of hk-ers (hong kong). and they're pissed off. they're cursing at the nwa manager at how poorly he's handled the situation and that the hk flight was finally announced to be cancelled even though it's still `indefinite` on the board. in addition he offered no alterior option such as a hotel or food vouchers.

note to self: never get on the bad side of an hk-er.

here's where ryan and i split up and i find myself in a field of japanese people. and you wouldn't believe this, but they're REALLY pissed off. i finally get to hear all of the japanese bad words i've learned from anime and what not haha XD. the gist of it is, our flight has been cancelled (btw, the hk people were pissed cause there's NO hk flight for 3 days), a lot of japanese swearing, and the manager runs away.

i'll admit it, i laughed haha.

i finally meet back with ryan when we finally find an english speaking representative who tells us the situation and the definition of `indefinite.` indefinite = the plane is not here, the flight is not cancelled but they have 0 idea on when it'll show up. 

gg.

btw, it's about 10:00 now. oh, and now we have angry americans trying to get a connecting flight home. and americans, when not getting what they expect, can be pretty upfront about it (which i imagine is the japanese worst fear eh?).

after much cursing and yelling on the customer sides, and the disatisfaction of 15oo people, i ask the english speaking rep what the hell is going on and she says our flight isn't guaranteed and that it's been rescheduled to 7am the next day.

and even then it's not guaranteed.

so ryan and i ask for our refunds in hopes to make the last train out of tokyo, 10:41, and it's around 10:26.

we head out of narita and make our way to tokyo as we finally arrive into shibuya around 12:50 am, where tired and exhausted, i pass out for the night in a capsule hotel.

so, as ryan said it best, it took us 13 hrs to get to shibuya.

it normally takes about 2.

so what's been happening with me lately...

book wise:
finished the wind up bird chronicle (murakami) and airframe (crichton) recently, and read prey (chrichton) and... can't quite remmeber the rest haha.

currently: looking for a new book.

travel wise:
seoul has been rescheduled to 11/2 - 11/5 and hopefully we won't run into the same troubles as we did last time.

weekends wise:
went to a music festival in odaiba in tokyo (where i still have a ringing in my left ear :[) with tammy. it was heaps fun and we went around shinjuku / asakusa / harajuku / and the ramen museum in yokohama.

the best would have to be in the ramen museum because the bottom two floors are built like the 1950's and 60's and there are 8 ramen shops down there... and we went ramen hoping.

tammy: itadakimasu... again!

seriously eh?

we were in this shanghainese ramen shop, where they're known for a kind of spicy ramen. it was really packed so we had to share a table with a japanese family. anyways, it turns out the two of them have lived in the states, (we didn't get their names) but one 7 years in LA, and the other 3 years (i forgot where). and that's when i said:

me: wow no wonder your english is very good.
father 1 (7 years in LA): no, my english not so good.
tammy: /shakesherhead.
father 2 (3 years): no, no it's not.

haha the second guy said it with the sternest face and perfect english.

and today:
me (15:03:41): trying to think of a halloween lesson
ames (15:04:04): halloween lesson?
a (15:04:08): hmmmmmmmmm
a (15:04:10): trick of treating
a (15:04:12): *or
m (15:09:01): lol
m (15:09:04): or....?
a (15:09:25): trick or treat
a (15:09:32): not...of...treating
a (15:09:33): lol
a (15:09:37): /inotfob
m (15:10:38): lol <3
a (15:10:56): >.<
m (15:12:03): hahahaha

hard to believe so much time has passed eh?

so, as i stated, lately i've noticed my journal transforming more into a giant ad for jon stewart. and to be fair, it has, but i can explain why.

the first would be that i've quit wow for the time being and i need something to fill up some few minutes every night.

the second would be that they've made me smile and laugh out loud, something i think is good for everyone.

regardless, i do have some real life updates to add in; culture festival (10/22), sports day (10/24), and my birthday (thank you mr. seebruck), but at the moment i just can't bring myself to add any entries. maybe later tonight.

BODY:
so i've been thinking lately that i've been neglecting this ole blog o mine, possibly because i've settled into a bit of a routine... again.

so what's new you might ask?

or not...

i just finished reading 'the kite runner' and i must say, highly recommended. next on the agenda, one of my birthday presents; 'way of the peaceful warrior.' i've been feeling like an uplifting book. this sunday is once again my school's brassband concert, and new this year, they asked me to record something on tape.

my line is: i want to hear u2. naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa (no exaggeration, they wanted me to hold it that long. and tilt my head.)

should be fun times. work related, my kids are beginning their in-class tests, which, once again is a skit in groups of 2 to 3. more importantly it means i'm free of lesson planning and teaching till next january ; ) unfortunately i have to make the practice final and the actual final as well. /sigh. oh, and of course grade each exam and grade their final projects as well. inbetween then and now, i'll have gone to the annual mid year seminar (i get to present a q&a session), and my school's brass band concert.

and on the side, yoshinoya began surving american beef for the first time since the ban lifted last decemember, and again last july (don't ask, i'm not sure how that happened either). needless to say, i still can't taste the difference.

and maybe it's just me, but i think the powers that be have been trying to hint something at me; when ryan and i were in seoul, we found an outback steakhouse at every bend. it is... my... des..ti...n...y?

and i think i can officially debunk the myth that koreans are hotter than most asians. seriously. they're just as ugly as the rest of us. :3

oh and i'll be going to a u2 concert and 2-3 thanksgiving dinners heh.

if only ovens existed in japan. turkeys too.

Hooray for being the main teacher, huh?  :\

Speaking of American beef, guess what I saw on the news this morning!  Yeah, some Japanese fucks are apparently having problems with it AGAIN.

I'll be attending a Thanksgiving dinner.  With turkey.  I'm bringing the oven.  ;)  (Yes, it's small, and they'll be small birds, but it'll still be turkey dammit.)

so friday night the yamadas, or as i like to refer to them: the nicest people on earth, invited the local alts to a friendly round a bowling (might i add mr. seebruck was kicking ass). anyways, the reason i was up for a day and a half was because the ingenius (stupid) plan by me, was to go check out the tsukiji fish market (which you guys should know i attempted to do a few months ago, but failed) or as tammy would say:

tammy: hey which side is it on?
me: it's on the 3rd platform... you know, this is YOUR station... you'd think of all the stations, it'd be this one you knew well...
t: well i do remember... i just forget a lot.

exactly.

anyways so we loitered around the station for 2 hrs till the train came and finally got to tokyo around 4:30ish in the morning. upon arriving at tsukiji at 5:21 am sharp. which leads me to the other question.

WHY are the japanese trains actually busy at this hour??!!!

oh, and tammy got away with getting to tokyo for about a dollar fitty (180 yen).

anyways, we were on a mission: to watch the world's tuna market, and to find the famous sushi restaurant 'daiwa' or as others like to put it, the best sushi of your life. the market was pretty neat in the sense that it was organized chaos. at any given time there were these modified fork lift thingys that turned on a dime and people packing fish to be shipped all over the world. at one point tammy and i saw this guy with this huge knife slitting the throat (if they have throats) of a live fish...

still waiting for angela to help with the photo posting :o

anyways we find daiwa in this dingy corner near the entrance to the market, waited an hour and a half from 6:30 am to eat there just to see if it warranted the hype.

and i can safelty say, it did.

BODY:
as of late i've been rather busy. with a full work week last week, preparations for the final class project (a skit like last year) the junior high open house (work on a saturday), and a detour to visit jon in hamamatsu as well as two days in kakegawa for the mid year seminar, and finally writing of the final exam for my kids... needless to say, i'm pretty drained.

however i've found a strange tranquility amongst it all that, i must say, is rather welcomed at this moment in my life. so first and foremost, to whoever is wondering: i will not be recontracting as an ALT with the JET program this year. my reasoning is that i don't believe that the amount of experiences and knowledge that i can gain from another year at the same post will warrant another year of my life. i truly have enjoyed my time here and have met some amazing people in the process. i took and will continue to take the JET program for the two years that i have allotted to it and believe it is time to make the next transition in my life.

and what might that be?

incquiring minds want to know!

me included.

i am going to come home first. i need to and want to touch base with many people back home and rack my brains for a bit. but i don't think i'll be in the US or at home by the end of the year. i'm incredibly tempted to work for another aspect of the JET program that is not as an english teacher or even find a job that would allow me to travel between asia and america freely / quite often. i don't think i'm ready to settle down and the fear of coming home right now is that i won't want to leave. it's not that i don't want to be home, but i just don't want to be tied down to a career just yet. not yet. i feel like there's still to much of the world i want to see, so many things i want to experience, and so much food i want to eat.

seriously eh?

perhaps come home and work for a year or two and then set off abroad again as well. maybe europe, south america, or africa... but i will definitely come home for after my contract expires this august. not entirely sure where the world will lead me, but for the moment it has not failed me in my ever going trek down this journey we like to call life.

and looking back, this is probably one of the first real entries i've had since sometime earlier this year...

i'll have to hand it to them. my kids this year did a lot better in their presentations than last year.

they're actually trying!!!

SHOKKU!!!

this year they seemed to have pulled out all the stops. keep in mind the only requirement is that it's in english, so they can pretty much do whatever they want. so far i've seen:

1. ultraman
2. foul mouthed poker players (i let them say 'shit' in the skit :D)
3. a bank robbery... gone wrong
4. they made a cardboard cutout for me to stick my face in. except they made the body about half the size of my head. OH, and i had a mustache!
5. they demonstrated me teaching
6. food... this one was good cause the last line of their skit was 'now i want something made of beef!' i asked them to slide the word 'american' into there ^^b.

anyways, there were heaps other good ones, but i thinkt he highlight had to have come from one of my 14 home room students (haruka) when she walked into class today:

haruka: hello!
h: my name is...
h: なんだけ。。。。。。
h: haruka!!

<3 my kids!

so of all the skits i've seen i think this one has to take the cake.

<strong>how does jeff's hair stand up?</strong>

the answer: i do yoga with my neighbor totoro. at first, only the plants start to stand, and then, my hair starts to stand up.

what it means... i have no idea. if my neighbor is totoro though, he sure does smoke a lot of cigarettes :P.

ellen and i have had this string of long conversations... but without the conversations. so lately we've been trying to avoid that by coming up with thought provoking conversations or simple conversations. the possibilities are endless:

me: shallow / deep conversation, GOOOO!!! 
ellen: lol! 
e: how are you? 
m: (i see we're going shallow today....) 
m: good, just got into work, yous? 
e: and what aspect of society do you think played the biggest role in assigning your current state? 
e: =P 
m: LOL 
e: and i'm still at wk =P

BODY:
that was unfuckingbelievable!!!!
 
my throat was sore, i was dripping with sweat, my body aching like no other, half my muscles cramping, and i wanted MORE! that's how much fun it was, that's how awesome it was, and that's the freaking best climax to waiting 11 years and trying four times to get tickets!!!! 

here's how it opened. fashionably late, and pitch black.

then right as the edge strikes the first chord for `city of blinding lights` one spot light in the middle of the room with bono holding japan's flag and the crowd going absolutely nuts. and it never stopped. another highlight was that for `one` he asked the entire audience to whip out their cells and light up the room. it was amazing. or during `sometimes you can't make it on your own` they had a simplified bono on screen to shadow the real bono. and don't forget all the little goodies that he's known for: changing his lyrics to fit as much of the venue's local and famous locations, playing to his audiences, and inserting quips from other songs into popular songs - i go to hear him do `in a little while` : ) - or how crazy the crowd went when he did pride, `in the name of love` or how amazingly silent it was when he did his acoustic duet with the edge with 'the first time' or the amazing note he held for miss sarajevo.
 
the only semi-not-cool things were 1. the floor was blocked off so you can't move. 2. it is not first come first serve.

so i waited 4 hrs for nothing hahaha.
 
but it was still awesome. you never realize how fun a concert is when you, and the entire crowd of 80ooo plus can sing along to every song. there are just no words to describe that.
 
as for my partner in crime, miss jane o'toole, who we met on the intern... er.. the concert.. yes... a tremendous thanks for accompanying me to one of the highlights of my life. had a blast and it was even better cause i could share it with her (she flew in from matsue japan for it!!!). 
 
as for the one song i wished they had played, i just sang it outloud at the top of my lungs after the concert...
 
and in the end you're left with a near broken body, gasping for water and air, an incredibly fond memory, and the pleasant thought that you'd do it all over again.

indeed.

well of coursre it's easy for me to say eh?

so what's new? reading wise:

i've finished 'way of the peaceful warrior' and to be honest, it wasn't fantastic. it felt like i read the abridged version, and that the full length version would have been indeed more promising. moving on to book two of my birthday presents, i'm reading 'conversations with God' and i'm actually finding this incredibly interesting. even if it's not the actual man himself that the author is talking with, i find it an incredibly fresh perspective on the whole take on faith and God.

an open mind is a must.

and finally, off the shelves of my highschool days, i'm reading 'catch 22' again... er, well for the first time haha.

some fun quotes:

ryan: you know what'd be nice? silk boxers... but don't you ever think about getting me any. ever.
me: but...
r: NO!

ryan: so... what kind of food will be there krist? armenian? ah, don't worry, we'll eat on the way home..

tammy: hey
t: will you bring my money to ramen tonight?
m: yes
m: but will you bring mine ;D
t: yeah
t: 47000 is a lot
m: lol yeah it is
m: well i have 13137 of your money
m: i paid 60ooo last year
t: hm
m: you can drop it to 47ooo - 13ooo
t: yeah
m: so you only need to bring 34ooo
m: it's worth it though heh
t: then you still owe me like, 170 yen right?
m: lol
m: yes
m: if you'd like
m: 137
m: i have your receipt too
t: yeah man. that'll buy me a bottle of tea
t: or a yogurt cup
m: hahahahha
m: atta girl ;D

so proud...

and as i said in the title, mikes tai and wu, as well as jenny and wendy, and alberto will be coming from the 19th to the 31st. exciting times indeed!

i won't lie, december went by really really really slowly.

not that that's a bad thing.

mike and mike plus a wendy and i'll raise you a jenny with an albert on the side have come and gone, and once again i find myself on my own again.

not that that's a bad thing either.

but it was honestly a clash of two worlds that never ceased to blow my mind away. for the most part, i tried to show them around to what i've come to know and come to call home for the last 18 months, in addition they showed me a few things i never even dreamed of existed in the places i felt i knew like the back of my hand.

it was good to take them to the yamadas for christmas... and see teru the next night... as well as show them around my school. the small bakeries, the endless bowls of ramen, the shink... all left me with a fuzzy feeling that reminded me of what it was like to be back home, almost as if i never left in the first place.

my personal highlight of the trip was getting to get up to nagano again. unlike last year where brad, ryan, masaya and i went to ueda, we went to where they ran parts of the olympic games in 98.

and oh yeah, they'll never let you forget the olympics were held there... 8 YEARS AGO.

i mean seriously, it's around every freaking corner!

all in all, it was great to see them all again. tsukiji sushi twice, tokyo way too many times, and even some proper onsen-ing aka sausage fest.

great way to finish out 06.

that means new antics right?

right right.

so mike x 2 and i were sitting at sushi dai in tsukiji where we just finished our 'chef's recommendation' set and we finally get the chance to pick one of our choosing (part of the set).

mike t chooses the classis otoro (fattiest of tuna cuts).

mike w chooses blue shrimp.

me, i thought i'd be clever. i asked for what ara / fujida / satoshi (the three chefs) recommendation was.

needless to say some bantering goes on (i miss big chunks of this haha) and finally they prepare something and set it on my table. the best i can describe this is that it looks like the yellow buds of bean sprouts, except they're white, slightly larger, and there's a good number of them. all over rice, wrapped in seaweed with a slight garnish of green onion and some sweet mustard (just a dab). in the words of our three chefs: eat it in one bite! it's only in season now!

well alrighty.

one bite later, i'im pleasantly surprised. it was pretty good. if you know your sushi, it goes in with a texture of ikura, then dissolves into a kind of bbq'd eel texture, and finally slides down the back of your throat, warm, with the consistency of chutoro (second fattiest tuna).

not bad.

mike x 2 felt somewhat obligated to check the menu for something else they might want to try, and asked what i just had. they point to one entry that stands alone.

sperm sacks of cod.

fantastic.

so last night at the yamadas, ross, ryan, and i spent a few moments recollecting the nifty commercials we've seen... coincidentally we found two common themes.

1. all were about sports...
2. all were nike ads...

let's go fun first.

<a href="http://www.kontraband.com/show/show.asp?ID=4710&NEXTID=0&PREVID=4658&DISPLAYORDER=20061030191952&CAT=tvads&NSFW=0&page=2&genre=0&rating=nsfw_sfw">this</a> is pretty funny.

now for the cooler ones:

the three of us agreed that <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-1374289816694973820&q=ronaldinho">this</a> is awesome.

<a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-1483670761495213547&q=ronaldinho">this</a> too!

but i have to say that, me personally, <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6744963954661597579&q=lance+armstrong+magnet">these</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NseKug63naM">two</a> neh!

ok first and foremost. i read this from pg2 on espn, and it made me laugh pretty hard:

• I can't believe how many readers predicted the following ending of the Pats-Colts game: Vinatieri shanks the game-winning field goal, rips off his jersey to reveal a Pats jersey, then runs across to the Pats sideline and jumps into Belichick's arms as Jim Nantz screams "Noooooooooo! Noooooooooo!" and Peyton Manning breaks out the greatest Manning Face of all-time. Would I sacrifice three months of my life for this to happen? Yeah, probably.

hahahaha, just re-reading it now made me laugh haha.

anyways, as i said in the title. ow. what happened? well ryan, me, and nakamura sensei (one of the teachers at my school) went to run a half marathon yesterday (21km), or about 12-13 miles give or take.

and me formally starting my training about 3 days earlier.

good job me!

anyways, the race starts and i kept telling myself that `i am not going to walk, i am not going to walk, i am not going to walk.` and that my only other goal being `i will finish, i will finish, i will finish.` was shortly lived right around the time i saw the 8 km mark.

<strong>please keep in mind that the farthest i've ever gone, is 4.8 km.</strong>

so around 8 i started noticing this pain in my left foot, right under the ball of my big toe. i hobbled along, slowing my pace down a bit, and i round the halfway point of 10.5 and finally as i'm getting to 12, i just needed to walk it off.

or so i told myself.

i walked for a good few hundred meters when i decided to start picking it up again.

and that's when it was hurting quite a bit.

so i found the patrolling first aid guys and asked for a little help with what i believed to be a blister.

upon taking off my sock, it was revealed to be a blister about the size of a half dollar, thus capping my run at 14 km, but...

i have pictures!

ok so not sure if many of you are aware of this fact, but my shower is quite possibly one of the poorest designed piece of shotty manufacturing that has ever graced this green earth of ours. quite literally:

it sucks.

now what exactly is it that is so horrible you ask (or not...)? well it's simple. it goes hot, to cold, to hot, to cold, to hot... in, give or take 5-7 min intervals. now first of all, i can shower pretty fast. i mean 5-7 minutes fast. but it doesn't help when the water startes turning to ice water right as i'm about to finish, thus extending my shower time almost 3 fold.

and you may think to yourself `well what's wrong with that?`

to which i will respond: ever live in a house/apt w/ 0 insulation?

to which i'll add: in winter and wet from head to toe?

exactly.

so where is this all going? well since my jp is fairly survivable, i go straight to the people in my school who are responsible for my apartment in hopes of getting a fix. this man, whom from now on will be known as akiyama san, is the person in charge of all jet/alt things both contract related and non-contract related.

needless to say he's a wiseguy to boot (don't get me wrong, he's funny as hell).

it's just always at my expense...

for example:

me: ugh, my shower, it goes hot, to cold, to hot, can i do anything about that?
akiyama san: wow... that sucks eh?
m: yes, yes it does.

/about5minutespasswithnothingsaid.

a: you're still here?

then the next time i went:

me: my shower is still going hot to cold and winter is coming. it'd be a bit hard to live through the winter, you know, without insulation, dripping cold, and waiting 5 minutes for the heater to kick in...
akiyama san: ah... well do you have a girlfriend?
m: no, but what does that have to do with anything?
a: you could go shower at her place!
m: ...oh
a: good luck!

and then there was the time after that:

me: ok so still going hot to cold, and i have friends coming over in a few weeks!
akiyama san: did you get a girlfriend yet?
m: ...no
a: well... why's that?
m: cause japanese girls don't like me?
a: what about the students? they seem to like you well enough.
m: but... they're 16...
a: all the better no?
m: i'm 24!
a: ah... well, what about the 3rd years?
m: NO!!!
a: have you tried asking them when they graduate? then it's only kind of illegal.
m: . . .
m: . . .
m: . . .

and then there's the time after that (which would be last week):

me: nope, still hot to cold hot to cold... this is really difficult cause, well, i like staying warm in the winter time, you know, dripping wet cold is not my idea of `enjoyable` :P.
akiyama san: well that's tough eh? i'll give them a call.
m: thank you! in the mean time what should i do?
a: have you tried [japanese i've never heard of]?
m: i don't understand...
a: ah, you know those zen monks who sit under icy waterfalls in winter time and pray /putshandstogetherandmumbles
m: ...

btw, this is when the ENTIRE office errupts in laughter.

and yes, at my expense...

m: ok, well if i can't?
a: well the 3rd years are about to graduate...
m: . . .
m: . . .
a: good luck!

why did i stay a second year again???!!!

(slightly edited for content):

On that day, at that time, in that place if I had not seen him, my school trip would have been boring. I had no friends with me. When I walked alone, I was spoken to by some bold foreigner. I guessed he was French. He spoke some Japanese to me. I was happy to talk with him because I was lonely. When we parted I was sad. I took this picture of him. This picture is my memory of my trip.

this is an anonymous student's show and tell script.

a+ in my book.

get your minds out of the gutter...

so last friday (2/9) ryan, mel, tammy, and i headed up to sapporo (their first time, my second) for, once again, the yukimatsuri(or snow festival). 

see my <a href="http://jet05.godspoken.net/archives/2006/02/index.html">feb 13th 2006</a> entry.

anyways, the trip was great fun as usual. even got travis to come out of oma in aomori prefecture to join us in the festivities (unfortunately he was sick). but hey still good fun eh.

i'm really glad for a few things this trip:

1. buckets of snow
2. baileys in an ice bar
3. good friends
4. 3 hrs of karaoke with kitty chan
5. a sports bar with an owner named chuo (who flexes when you meet him) and his bartender alpha.
6. the world's greatest ramen
7. catching up with good friends
8. ridiculously long snowball fight at 5 am (absolutely the best, thanks aga, amy, and ryan for all the facefulls of snowballs and sprinting through the streets of sapporo)
9. the city of otaru (again).
10. onsening in the snow.

shoot me if i miss anything. as usual, sapporo remains my favorite place in japan. i will truly miss it.

thanks again guys, it was a blast!

oh hey and look, 300th entry. grats jetblog!

this has to be quite possibly one of the coolest things i've ever seen.

and i didn't even do it on purpose...

i was eating lunch today, and i have these big bowls that are, well, ridiculously large cereal bowls. i had one on the floor and one in my hand. i put my chopsticks on the one on top as i reached over to pause my mplayer to get more food in said bowl in hand.

at that moment, my left hand (one with the bowl) tilts and i see my chopsticks go over.

i catch one with my left thumb and then thought oh shit!

here's what happened:

the chopstick falls point first into the bowl.
at which time it follows the contour of the bottom of the bowl and then returns straight up into the air (like a pro skater in a halfpipe) point up. it proceeds to do a 360 (at least, think a wheel spinning) and then lands properly on the bowl on the floor, never touching the ground, and as if i had just set it there purposely from the start.

and i hate to steal a line from keanu reeves.

you never really fully understand how powerful those words can be since we all use it so much.

i just finished teaching my last class of the school year, 16 home room. and to be perfectly honest, they have been my favorite class to have taught in the last two years. in addition i'm glad to have stayed that second year to be able to teach 16 home room.

and as i closed up the final minutes of class today, i told them how i felt. and even before the jte (japanese teacher of english) translated what i said into japanese, they gave me an ovation and started to yell out `thank you.`

i don't think i've ever been this choked up before...

to my favorite class from the last two years...

thank you.

final exams!

and with final exams, we have my beloved bonus section.

but first, a few updates. currently i'm still reading catch 22, i know it's been 3 months since i started but to be honest, i've been ridiculously exhausted as i ride trains these days and i just find myself passing out. up next on this list is hopefully another murakami, and then sherlock holmes vol. 1.

we just finished a 3 day conference in yokohama that was mainly to help us get back on our feet for when we all go back to our home countries (respectively of course). good to meet some old friends and find some new. as always aeon (my second cousin who started jet the same time i did) seemed to always find me there (and i him), and as always, ryan and i never really hang out during such events.

another note, chris from back home is in tokyo now for a transfer program from his job. he's only here for six months, but it blows my mind when he's just beginning his six months, and i have about six months to go on my own contract. in addition, it feels like the home stretch where as it's just the beginning for him.

and the final update, the third years just had their graduation ceremony yesterday... though i did spend most of the time fixing my bike and eating a snickers...

now, onto the final exam answers!

this term brings back an old question (mainly cause i couldn't think of a new one, so sue me :P): `where is jeff from? and `how cool is jeff?`

will post it in the next entry.

so because of heavy rainfall monday night, my ramen night was postponed to tuesday night. thankfully ryan was willing to come keep me company as it was a slow night with the yamadas. keep in mind that last sentence was a bit sarcastic, think of it as someone offering to take you to eat with the nicest people on the face of the planet earth (well japan at least). would you honestly say `no` ?

didn't think so.

anyways! we finish our meal and yumiko hands us these little individually wrapped packages that read `bata dori.`

me: so what do you make of this?
ryan: i dunno. looks like mini pancakes with azuki (aka red bean) wedged in the middle.
m: well they gave it to us... can't be that bad...

/weopenandtakeonebite

r: what the hell is that in the middle of the azuki?
m: wouldn't that be awesome if it was actually a slab of butter?
r: haha yeah seriously. wouldn't that be hilarious, i mean we know it's normally in the dessert, but who actually puts a visible slice of butter there.

both: nervous laughter.

m: serious, i mean it's not as if butter rolls come with a fat slab of butter, that shit's baked in so you can at least pretend it's not there...

/ibiteintoit

m: omg that's...
r: no, it's not.

/ryanbitesintoit

r: see. it's not eve... omg yes. ...it's a slab of butter.
m: man they're really not even trying anymore are they?
r: well, it is bata dori...

both: ...

you can just hear yourself getting fatter...

holy crap, it's been 10 days!

finally back from china and let me say, it was... /chuckle... pretty amazing.

3/9 - 3/10 -> shanghai
3/10 -> took the sleeper train to xian. think titanic... but on a train.
3/11 -> xian
3/11 -> took the sleeper train to beijing
3/12 - 3/16 -> beijing
3/16 -> took the sleeper train to shanghai
3/17 -> shanghai
3/18 -> back in tokyo

highlights of the things we saw:

1. the great wall - walked 10km of it or 1/630th of it
2. the forbidden city - even after you pay it's kind of forbidden...
3. tian'anmen square - opened on the LAST day we were in beijing
4. terracotta warriors - really really cool to see in person

and of course [mike wu] i ate at nanxiang steamed buns, and peking duck @ quanjude and @ da dong roast duck. btw: duck fat and sugar is ridiculously good... though i will say i think that taiwanese food is better... mmmm taiwanese food... :)

...and the hostel staff in beijing said that they think i'm cute :D

like goofs and gallant.

except not.

anyways, back from china and fully recovered (slept till 3:30 yesterday), been getting a few questions like `how was your mandarin?` and...

well ok, just that question. let's just say this is more or less how them 10 days went:

mike: haha ok
mike: so shanghai #1
mike: did you get a table
mike: or stand in line
me: table
mike: to be honest, i didn't think the buns there were better than at ding tai fong
mike: but still 
me: i wasn't impressed
mike: gotta go
mike: it's famous
me: they were good
me: let me tell you
me: that hostess did NOT appreciate me being illiterate ahahaha
mike: lol
me: `so um... yes... i'd like some xlb... and... could you tell me what number 2 is?.... and number 3....` 
me: `....4?`
me: 5 items on the menu
mike: `....5?`
mike: `...and what was 4 again?`
me: lol 
me: exactly....
me: `...could you explain them all as if i was 5?`
mike: hahaha 

in the end i took a few orders of everything...

on the flight to shanghai though, i met a pastor named hugo who gave me a pretty interesting conversation. he's probably given me one of the better talks of my life in addition to the greatest comeback of my life:

me: you know, i've just grown so cynical of it all.
hugo: well jeff... maybe things will get better for you when you are cynical of your own cynicism.

lol oh yeah, and one more thing.

i'm no big history buff, so when i went into china i saw all these things about `mao is great` not quite exact but more or less to that extent. and so when i got back to japan i had to do one thing:

wiki up mao.

and let me tell you something i discovered in my researching.

he wasn't a nice guy.

in fact he was downright mean...

... what's wrong with this picture?

...again.

back from kl and siem reap, back from the petronas towers and angkor wat, and not likely to leave the country again till it's time to go home...

that, and i have no more pto and no more blank pages in my passport haha.

it was really good to see susie again, it was not so great to fly for 12 hrs + 4 hrs to get to the airport. it was a blast though, the awesome people at the <a href="http://www.redpalm-kl.com">red palm</a>, more specifically one of the owners, sofie, makes you feel at home right away. i swear i woke up thinking that i was back home for a bit. twas a good feeling.

cambodia is pretty amazing. susie and i arrived on the 26th and checked into our hostel where we met the guy who picked us up, and later became our driver for the trip, bhunta (at least i think that's how you spell it). had really amazing cambodian food; khmer kitchen (ask for pise) and the red piano, as well as the blue pumpkin for a trendy place to cool off (and believe me you'll need it). we saw angkor wat for 3.5 days, and in that span i saw 2 sunrises and 3 sunsets.

i even biked their at 3:30 am once thinking it'd take me an hour to get there.

it took me about 20 minutes.

i got chased by a dog too...

susie even took me to the landmine museum which was quite possibly both the dodgiest and the most profound museum i've ever been to; it's literally strewn together with wooden boards and there are live chickens running around hollowed out and difused ammunition.

thursday was particuarily special because i got to visit the pepy school that susie worked for last year. we helped paint three of the class rooms and got to play with the kids for a few hours; this was by far the highlight of my trip.

that and getting talced by little elementry school kids (i have a photo) and letting them ride on my shoulders.

to be continued...

i think i really did fall for cambodia though. through the ghettoness and the veil of a developing country, you can see the geniune-ness of the people there...

well of course minus the people who say `lady, you want ice water?` or `lady, you want to buy my books?` or `lady you want to buy [seriously random things]`

we'd be coming down a temple or hill, dripping with sweat, dehydrated and starving and we get:

`hey lady, you want to buy our lonely planet books?`

seriously...

kl is an interesting middle step though. you have gems in the skyline like the petronas towers (btw, the video they make you see on the tour is the biggest pr attempt i've ever seen) but it was really cool to chill in the park below at night with a beer and just admire them.

and then the cops come with whistles a blowing to kick you out at 10 on the dot.

indian food is really good here too, and i've seen some pretty strange stuff (link to come soon).

all in all, it's good to be back, and dry, and where the bikes (the siem reap bikes were built for an american teenager i swear) that fit me... relatively.

funny thing is is that it's april now, and only four more months to go before i come back for good.

it feels all too close and all too far away at the same time.

school's in that slow period again as classes for my first year students don't start till 4/16. i have the first lesson plan done as well (self intro) and the next lesson plan after that not required till 4/9 later... thus i am in no rush to really get it done...

so.

nakamura sensei comes up to me, intriqued by the salt and vinegar chips i have on my desk. we get to talking and (i assure you this was the actual conversation):

me: i'm bored. are you busy?
nakamura sensei: yes very.
me: what do you have to do?
ns: i am new 16 home room teacher.
me: congratulations!
ns: after lunch, have to clean home room.
me: oh...
ns: very happy!
me: haha, why?
ns: ...it's joke :P.

BODY:
when you, if you, ever find yourself in cambodia, or from my experience, siem reap, you'll have little kids come at you with many a things including:

water
tshirts
bracelets
books
food
more bracelets

and most of these run for about a dollar or so.

now that doesn't sound like much, but me personally: 1. don't believe in supporting this industry (if it can be called that), and 2. i'm a cheap bastard.

and of course i'm an ass as well. why?

here were my responses to the kids asking me to buy things:

1. answer in mandarin
2. answer in japanese
3. answer in broken spanish pretending that it's fluent spanish
4. answer in a mix of all three
5. run away (i really did this... susie ended up buying something though haha)

but of course let me give you a few examples of what i did:

little kid 1: hey, you buy my bracelet?
me: no thanks (in mandarin).
lk1: please buy? (in korean)
lk1: no...
lk1: please buy? (in japanese)
lk1: no... that's not it
me: if you can aske me in mandarin, i'll buy one (in mandarin).
lk1: speak english i don't understand :[

it's also quite fun to just yell out random gibberish...

now here's what i don't get.

cambodia is HOT. and i mean HOT. susie and i were running about 4-5 liters of water EACH per day. so we're climbing down from a temple in the hot midday sun, and this is what happens as we walk by:

cambodian: want to buy lonely planet?

...you... got to be kidding me. i mean let's be honest, if you're going to peddle to tourists, you can at least peddle something useful. i mean that's like the time we were climbing the great wall and they tried selling us pictures and books...

a tip from me to you: it's hot, people are sweating, and you want to sell something? TRY WATER.

serious.

last one i swear.

least for now anyways :D

kids in cambodia try to get you to buy anything, and in trying to get you to buy anything they try to get to know you, impress you with their english (which is quite good i might add), and likewise i must be a dick about it.

one clever thing they do is tell you the capital of where you're from.

littlekid2: hey, where you from? america? england? singapore? hongkong?
me: timbuktu.
lk2: ... i don't know where that is...

haha it's ok, i know i'm going to hell.

oh right, i forgot to explain WHY i'm a dick to these little kids trying to sell me things.

and why i always speak a foreign language to them (becuase i REFUSE).

last year when susie was here, there was this really big hulking guy named brian, looked tough as a sack of bricks and then some.

and he rejected these kids all the time.

that is until ONE kid said this after he said `no.` imagine it went like this:

brian: hey that was fun guys right? haha.
littlekid3: please buy my bracelets? one dollar!
brian: sorry kid, no thanks.
lk3: but only one dollar, you get 10, so pretty! (yes they're like this).
brian: i'm good kid, thanks.
lk3: but you can give to your girl friend!
brian: no really i'm good, thanks.
lk3: but i made them for you...
brian: i'm sorry no...
lk3: <strong><u>you make my soul cry.</u></strong>

needless to say he was devastated for a few days.

amazing.

last weekend ryan and i were invited by nakamura sensei (ran the marathon with us, commercial teacher at my school) invited us to his home for lunch.

little did we know what was in store of us.

his mom presented us with a six course HAND MADE lunch.

first course: hand squeezed grapefruit mixed with cider topped with flower pedals with a glass cup filled with, what appears to be noodles, made of melon garnished with a mint leaf, apple slices, and ikura (fish eggs) followed with a folded sweet egg wrapped around bbq'd eel, garnished with two lima beans, and a (i think it was) a boiled chest nut covered in gold flakes.

second course: a hand made, no steamer used, rice laced with red beans and black sesame seeds accompanying a steamed egg filled with bamboo, mushrooms, bits of meat and garnished with a single cherry blossom.

third course: a hand made (starting to sense a theme in this eh?) spring roll, filled with egg, chicken, pork, nuts, some veggies, and garnished with a lemon.

fourth course: freshly caught fish, presented with the fins standing up (if you have any idea how hard this is) on a bed of thin noodles garnished with leafy greens accompanying a vinegaresque dipping sauce with green onions and sesame seeds.

fifth course: fresh bamboo (only in season now) with pork and hand steamed (or hand made, not sure how you steam rice without a rice cooker) as well as a ginger soup with baby clams. vinegared cucumbers carrots radishes topped with fish flakes and asparagus.

sixth course: an original, hand made, mt. fuji with yam as the snowy cap and a macha mountain base, it's layered to look as natural as possible. it is served with two strings of macha noodles and a sour plum jelly.

MAN that woman can cook. 

oh yeah, she's NOT a chef, she's a housewife.

and oh yeah, IT WAS AMAZING.

someone needs to start her own restaurant.

oh yeah and she also makes hand made ornaments out of hand selected kimonos.

catch-22 is finished!

of 453 pages, only the first 300 were painful :P

next book: travels by michael crichton.

btw, awesome house moment:

House: You bastard! You invited my parents to dinner.
Wilson: Geez Cameron's got a big mouth!
House: Hah! Not as big as yours!
Wilson: Hey! You used me to avoid seeing your parents.
House: Well what do you care?
Wilson: I don't, I just thought it might be interesting to find out why.
House: You could have just asked.
Wilson: You would have lied!
House: And you would have believed me! Which would have kept us both happy. You want your money back? Is this what this is about?
Wilson: No! ...Wait, what... have you got the money?
Wilson: If you have the money then why did you need the loan?
House: I didn't. Just wanted to see if you could give it to me. I've been borrowing increasing amounts ever since you lent me 40 dollars a year ago. A little experiment to see where you draw the line.
Wilson: ...You ...you're trying to... objectively measure how much I value our friendship?!
House: Hey, it's 5 grand. You've got nothing to be ashamed of. So what do you say? One little phone call and one big cheque?
Wilson: Fine. Thanks. Now, be a grown-up and either tell mommy and daddy you don't want to see them, or I'm picking you up at 7 for dinner.
House: What do you mean?!!! You just said that..
Wilson: I lied. I've been lying to you in increasing amounts ever since I told you you looked good unshaved, a year ago. ...It's a little experiment, you know, see where you draw the line.

best!

for the record, i am apologizing in advance for the lack of updates in addition to the quotidian (thank you seebruck) entry that you're all about to receive.

that being said.

golden week has come and gone, and it always seems like no matter what holiday comes up, the moment i blink i find myself getting ready to go to work again. sad isn't it? my dad brought the farm to japan for golden week; mom, brother, brother's wife, grandma, aunt, and dad himself, as i found myself on a train bound for narita (except i'm not going anywhere... kind of like south korea <a href="http://jet05.godspoken.net/archives/2006/10/index.html">part 1</a> see 10/11 entry) but with a positive twist; i get to see my family again.

as justin would say: that's love.

another surprise: i'm not sure if i've mentioned this... knowing me i probably have, but it seems that a good number of people actually read this blog. and not just the handful that i shamelessly name dropped before i left for japan, but some people i would never have expected!

i swear i will buy you all steak dinners or something.

it's a pleasant unexpected surprise that brings me much happiness knowing that there are people who enjoy my writing, writing style (yes travis and ryan, i know you two probably read it the most <3 <--- a heart).

other news... 

i'm halfway through travels, and i must say, it is quite the enjoyable read, hopefully will be done by next week (been reading much more sporadically than usual), hope to be on sherlock holmes volume 1 in the meantime.

after showing my parents around for the last four days, it's all finally come full circle, more or less, in the sense that both my worlds have finally collided as the people closest to me have seen my reclusive life in japan. on the bright side it's left me eager to return home to get my life back on track and finally get a chance to sign off on this long mortal coil that has wound up to be two years of my 24 on this blue pearl we call home.

with only three or so more weeks of teaching left, my closet now 80% empty from my parents taking two suitcases full home, and the days warming up, my time left in japan seems to be shorter and shorter, and as ryan said to me earlier today; i just realized how little time we have here and how much shit we have to do.

indeed.

ryan: oh man, if you're ever in the mood to do something stupid, do this:

1) move to a foreign country and stop eating cheese for 2 years so your body is no longer used to processing it.
2) eat a small block of cheese for lunch.
3) Teach for 3 consecutive hours after lunch in agony as your digestive system gives you the equivalent of the finger and a "I hope you're happy now, you jackass."

that is the question.

everytime i have a bit of the sniffles, my teachers get concerned.

`oh you have a cold...` they say.
`have you been to the hospital?` they ask.
`are you alright? maybe you should take paid time off.` <--- yeah right.

now one thing you guys have to know about me and japanese `hospitals.` i hate them. i really really hate them. why you ask?

1. they look like they're housed out of shack.
2. there is no lab.
3. it does not look sterile.
4. the x-ray machine must be cerca 1940's.
5. every japanese doctor is a hypochondriact in that whatever minor symptom you have, he'll assume it to be a form of cancer, terminal disease, or the rarest thing in the book. honest.

so lately my eyes have been irritated due to the pollen in the air and every friday 4th period, fe sensei (from the philippines), and goto sensei (whom we all should know by now), are in this empty room so we can talk without getting in any trouble by the man.

fe: jeff, go to a doctor. they will help you.
me: no, i don't want to because [reasons above].
fe: ok even so, your eyes are all red!
me: they'll go away! besides, all the hospitals in japan are ghetto.
fe: well how about if i recommend some for you?
me: go for it.
fe: how about ishida?
goto: ah, ishida is good! you can go tomorrow.
me: but does he speak english?
goto: that's good question. one second. [opens door to adjacent room] miss yamaguchi, can you [leaves the room]

30 seconds pass.

goto: [comes back]ok, miss yamaguchi says go to kato.
me: where is it?
goto: 2 minutes from school.
me: is it any good fe?
fe: it's good, isn't that right mr. goto?
goto: yes! very pretty nurses!
fe and me: ...
goto: what?
me: i want an answer though, not something to look at.
fe: come on mr. goto, what about their doctors?
goto: yes, pretty nurses...

...

i still can't tell if i should chalk that up to `pro` or `con` :P

...throw away your receipts.

in preparation to going home i've been talking about getting everything ready so as the clock rolls around to august 1st, i get to get the hell out of here and not look back.

but in discussing bills, i brought up one thorn that has been in my side since the beginning:

i had to pay for my predecessor's internet bill cause the guy didn't cancel it before he left... so i ended up paying for it.

true it was only 24 bucks, but hey, principle.

then akiyama san tells me something interesting:

`if you can bring the receipts, i can reinburse you.`

reheeeheeeheeeheaaaaaaaaaaaaalllllllllllllllllllllllllllly.

so, chalk one up to keeping your bills and keeping them organized, cause i just received 2754 yen.

:D

in addition, i got reinbursed for an older business trip worth a whopping 440 yen.

so i just got back 3194 yen today :D

which i'm going to spend on karaoke...

life is good...

so, as requested by my brother, here's an update.

which for the record i apologize for due to nothing really happening in my life besides work and getting ready to head back.

seriously, it's so slow here, paint dries faster.

so on sunday ryan, me, nakamura sensei, and nakamura sensei's friend (who didn't show) headed back to ushihama (remember my <a href="http://jet05.godspoken.net/archives/2007/01/index.html">attempt</a> at a 21km half marathon?) but this time it's to do a simple 4 man relay, 5km each.

now me, being my usual stuff, had managed to get myself out of shape... again.. (i swear it gets harder each time... really), find myself really psyched up. so psyched up that as we were watching the previous race finish up, i just had to say this:

me: ok this is going to sound really gay, but you know what's hot?
ryan: what?
me: guys with shaped calves.
ryan: yeah... that is...

[insert pause for comedic timing]

ryan: ...pretty gay.

...

i can hear my brother now...

lately i haven't been able to eat breakfast - mostly cause i oversleep a bit (actually a lot) and find myself running out the door to get to class.

so lunch came around yesterday, and lately, i've been bringing it to my desk and chatting with tomono sensei and tajima sensei (who sits to my immediateleft and two sports over on my left respectively).

me: YAY FOOD!
tomono sensei: what?
me: yay... food?
tajima sensei: what do you mean?
me: it just means i'm simple :D
tj: i don't understand... please explain
me: well ok, you know how some people are really happy if you buy them jewelery, cars, expensive items?
tj: yes.
me: well i just (yes this is the actually translation of the word, though a scosh literal... just a scosh) achieve the most supreme happiness in the universe when i get food. thus simple to make happy.
tj: oh i get it...
tomono: yeah, means he's cheap.

...

5 letter word... rhymes with stitch...

i let my 2nd year business english class watch `independnce day` last week. goto sensei asked them all to write a summary of the sorts and turn it into me, well, the day before yesterday.

one of the students is actually very good at english (had her in my oc1 class last year), and i just loved the summary she wrote for the movie:

Because a meaning of this title was "Independence Day". Why is it this title. I thought so... This movie importance to a beloved person and Human thought. Human stupidity. And I was able to watch splendid. Before the president fights against a spaceship. That he said to pilots was very splendid. Racial discrimination stop. Always I want the peace world to become it. The alien was grotesque...

hehe that last line is seriously the best.

BODY:
it really really doesn't.

so last friday i headed up to sado island to visit my cousin aeon who's also on the jet program. last year he came down to shiz and the fuj to visit me and i always said i'd repay the favor. so here it is: how to get to sado island!

1. take 1hr 13 min shink to tokyo.
2. take 2 hr 7 min shink to niigata.
3. take 15 min bus ride to ferry terminal.
4. take 2 hr 30 min ferry ride to niigata. <---- i bought the cheapest ticket and hid in the `special class` (one up of first class) lounge hehe.

i left home at 3:10pm, i arrived at 10:00pm.

fun times!

anyways, really really good to see what life is like for my cous, and let alone another side of japan. i think i got the tingles when he said the only real thing to do there was drive along the northern coast for 3 hrs...

oh and i really lost it when he offered that we traverse said adventure on his motorcycle, and me following on a scooter.

first time on a scooter, and a 3 hr coastal ride?

best!

seriously it's easily one of the best moments of my life, to push that little scooter to 60 km/h (~38 mph) with the sea on your left and this gorgeous greenery on your right and pretending i'm not on some pansy scooter, but a nice bike...

regardless it was a great weekend, we went firefly catching, ate curry out of a bus, went to a concert (that was... no comment...) but at the end aeon got up and did a piano solo of `desperado` and THAT was gold! made a restaurant regret the words `all you can eat,` and painfully learned how out of shape i am when we played a game of 1 on 1, and visited the only 5 story pagoda in all of niigata.

big thanks to my cous again for hosting, and hope to be able to do that drive again except on a real bike next time.

see ryan, i am cultured...

even though we walked in and out in under 6 minutes...

still... cultured!

and i was having dinner with chris and annabelle sunday night on my way back from sado, and we ate some pretty hot peppers (why would they do this to us?).

anyways, we got around to discussing the best remedies to it, and we all agreed that milk was the best, but `why?`

just thought i'd share this with all of you.

milk or other dairy products to soothe your mouth because they contain a casein, a protein that breaks the bond capsaicin forms with pain receptors.

this is what i do while at work...

i'll leave my friend anon for this one, but here's the skinny:

last night i had a dream where two of my friends were with me karaoke-ing (yes it's a verb) with a few other people and there was a girl who was giggling in a group of japanese people just off to our left. one of them came out and asked one of my best mates to come to their group really quickly for a bit. upon his return, he came back with a really large grin on his ear and said, and i quote (serious), `man, i couldn't be happier.` upon which i ask `what happened?` and his response?

`i got a gf now.`

and me, being the ever curious fool that i am, dart into the other group of japanese people and finally stumble upon my friend's said gf.

it was one of my students. she's 17. and in my dream i have the same expression as you probably do right now: jaw dropped, shocked expression, slightly pale.

so the first thing i did when i woke up today and got into work, i im'd the whole story to him.

anonymous: haha no, and why wasn't it [insert name of other mutual friend], why'd it have to be me?
me: well, cause we're single
me: lol
anon: HAHAHA
anon: fair enough......fair.........enough........
me: and thank GOODNESS it wasn't me
me: then there'd be something wrong...
anon: rite rite
anon: but me.....
anon: i mean.......thats okay
anon: 17 yr old
anon: [anon's real name]
anon: nothing ODD about that
anon: YEA THANKS MAN
anon: thats it......im going home
me: lol
me: big <3

can't wait to go home...

currently i'm giving interview tests to all my kids. mainly it consists of a 1 minute introduction section where i ask them as many of 9 questions as i can and then a 1 min free response section following one of three topics.

keep in mind, low level school where they answer my `how are you?` with `how are you?`

there were two kids in particular who i asked the same question:

what is your favorite food?

best answer so far: meat.

i'm starting to think i should be more specific...

the date posted says the `5th` but that's japan time, it's the fourth back home.

trust me.

so i know for any of you who've come to read this blog that most of my entries are kind of random bantor of things i've done, little musings of my own, and conversations that got me to laugh, and links that more or less put a smile on my face.

but this time i'm thinking i'll give you guys something a little more serious in tone.

please bear in mind that i'm not really articulate.

last night i had planned to have dinner with brian and albert, but due to brian's test marking and the pouring rain, we all agreed upon a later date to catch up and chew the fat so to speak. that said, i found myself lying on my spongy blue couch (which i still argue is the best couch in the world) with itunes on random and the rain just falling in buckets outside (i love the rain btw).

and then it hit me.

i'm going home.

now you have to understand that last night as i was staring up at my roof, it's never been `you're going home in x months and x days` everytime i look up, but for the first time it was. it was the thought that, as weird as this sounds (to me anyways), two years have passed and now i'll be going home in 27 days.

i was talking to ryan about this and he said, `you think that's nuts, i have 20 days left!` that's just shy of three weeks, but it really put things into perspective.

i'm really leaving, and i know that sounds redundant, but it's not like when i left home for uni, and it's not like when i left uni to come home. this little stinky town has been my home, i've spent the last two years of my life here and now it's all going to come to an end as i pack up the last of my belongings and tie up every lose end here. i've never really just thought about everything in the sense that this is just a page in my life. this has been my home, and despite all the quirks that come with it (damn you shower), i still feel the most at ease here and now i'm on the verge of just letting it go, passing it on to the next guy after me.

all in all, it leaves me with a kind of emptiness, a thought that unlike when i was running through undergrad and everyone tells me that these are going to be the best years of your life, i'm actually aware of it now.

and that makes me sad that it's all coming to a close.

but the thing is, i know this is the time that i should close this chapter in my life, i know what i'm doing is what's best for me, i just can't help but feel a kind of pain that weighs down at the bottom of my heart.

maybe this doesn't make sense to you guys, maybe it does, heck i don't even know if i can really say i even understand my own ramblings.

it's amazing to me how everyday we are imparted with the wisdom and advice of our peers, our seniors, and yet we never really understand them, fully understand them, until you find yourself in a situation that demonstrates that you really don't understand them.

and even words.

i can finally tell each and everyone of you that this truly is the textbook definition of bittersweet.

it's official.

i have taught my last class (the last time i said this, i meant more as in official ciriculum) but this was it.

it was 15 home room and as i tried to find words to say how i felt, one of my loudest students, hideto, started to clap, and everyone else got to clapping... i was touched. i won't lie... this is only the second time it's happened and i'm glad to know that my time here wasn't in vane...

that you get this sense of closure, from that first day i stepped into the classroom to this final day two years later, it's almost all come full circle, and all that remains is 26 little days...

BODY:
ok i think last night had to be the testament to `lost in translation` so to speak.

so as most of you know i've been studying <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iaido">iaido</a> and i'm hoping to get shodan for it before i leave for japan. i txt'd my teacher before i dressed asking if it was alright to take the exam next week as i didn't think i'm ready for it this week. anyways, i've been practicing for about half a year and last night my teacher finally says `do you want to try for it tonight?`

keep in mind i said earlier that i asked for permission for next week.

so i thought `sure, why not.`

but first a little back story: about a month ago, my teacher gave me:

1. a katana diagram labeling all parts of the katana to which i had to memorize
2. a smaller sheet of the names of the six forms i had to do
3. an official request to attempt shodan

so i practiced the form once in front of the two other students (watanabe san, and i honestly can't remember her name, but she drives a 318i... and that's just minus points). and then i finally got down to doing it. upon finishing though, he asked me to take the written exam, i.e. the parts of the katana... or so i thought.

i left about 2 spaces blank and then i noticed another section which i thought was necessary for nidan, or the second level.

nope... i was wrong.

he sat down and told me what i had to write down the form names, and i admitted that, well, i didn't really study the names of the forms at all. so we sat there in a bit of an awkward silence, and at that moment, i realized:

he wasn't showing me the name of the forms just to show me what i had to remember. he was showing me the names of the forms because i was going to be tested on them!

good. job. me.

BODY:
on monday night, as i made my usual round towards mnr (monday night ramen), i came down to the platform at fuji station and turned right and saw a kid with headphones on who looked up and we both looked away. and then i thought, <em>wait a minute</em> and we both looked up at each other.

it was manabu!

for those of you who don't know (and i think that's all of you), manabu was a 3rd year student who graduated in march of this year. little side twist, during graduation, i was taking pictures with all the 3rd year students that i got along with or that wanted to take a picture with me, but i could never find manabu.

i mean come on, our daily greeting at school was a handshake, a one handed hug, and a slap on the back (well ass really, but that would sound kind of, you know, three letter word, rhymes with `hey`) heh. i really respect this kid cause he's polite, friendly, and tries really hard at even speaking english to me.

i learned that he's studying ecology at a university in fuji, that his twin brother (didn't know!) is studying the same thing and that his older brother is in gifu studying as well. he's apparently doing really well, though not practicing kendo anymore, and learning french and basketball.

and apparently he's taking 20 classes.

anyways, with a quick picture from my cell (didn't have my digi) i wished him the best of luck on his studies and told him to enjoy the time he has now. he wished me well as well and we parted ways.

though i'm not sure that we'll get a chance to meet again, i am genuinely glad to have been able to see him one last time before i left japan.

i wish him the best, and know he'll go far in life :)

20 classes eh?  Sounds about right.  Japanese university's a bit different how it's set up; I remember talking with a few of my Japanese friends and they told me how the classes are generally (1)disgustingly easy, (2)you don't need to go to class except for like, the first day, midterm, and final, and (3)the time period, like, semester-wise is much shorter or something, so you can take a lot more classes that way.

books:
i finished `travels` by crichton and i have to say, it was a great book, probably one of the best i've ever had a chance to read, and i (seebs more so) HIGHLY recommend that you all take a look when you have the time (or you can just borrow it from me!)

currently i'm reading `the adventures of sherlock holmes` volume 1 of 2, and i must say, it is a fast read, minus the english bits (you know, lift instead of elevator, hoover instead of vacuum), finished up the first story, a study in scarlett, and am almost done with the sign of four.

something amusing:
me: man fuji kind of... you know... smells...
tomono sensei: well, it's kind of like miso.
me: ...
both of us: hahahahaha!

cause you know what it <strong>doesn't</strong> smell like?

and as ryan asked for, something good:
i gave my final exam to my business english kids today, a small elective class of only 5 kids, all whom i've taught with the year before in oc, and all really good kids.

as the last bell rang, i asked them all to stand up, and gave my last few words of advice to them:

i told them that that they shouldn't listen to english teachers (or any teachers for that fact) who say `you can't do it` or `your level is just low,` that 1. if they believe that they can do it, that they can, and 2. that if their pronunciation and syllables are good, they will have 0 problems and definitely impress everyone they speak english to. and finally that i was happy to have them and how proud of them i was and that i wished them the best in life.

they clapped

and two of them wrote me letters :[

i'm not going to cry...

the 365th entry of my blog!

a few mondays ago ross got this excellent picture from tokyo, a good scandalous picture... and, like any good chap, we passed it around and all put it on our cell phones.

now that isn't the problem, the problem has occured three times, but i think the best of it has to have been tonight during iaido practice, but first, the other two times!

1. during the interview test, i used my cell as a timer, and as such, when i opened my cell in front of my students... there's that picture.

2. i got a jp message from my iaido sensei and asked my jte to translate it. after awhile i said, 'nm' and pressed 'exit' to which it cheerfully displayed said picture to my jte.

3. and this is the best. at iaido practice tonight, i sat down and my sensei comments on how i'm earlier than usual today and that he sent me a txt. likewise, i reach for my phone and open it to the txt message and as i'm exiting it i notice he's looking over my shoulder.

usami sensei: so... i see you're taking pictures with your phone now!
me: ... yes...
sensei: can i see it?
me: ...
sensei: ...
me: ...no?
sensei: ...

two years ago on this day, i started rambling on about anything that i found interesting or amusing during my time in japan that i thought only i could understand.

little did i realize i actually have quite a few people who enjoy reading my ramblings.

to all of you, thank you for your patience and your (sort of) stalking (just kidding).

big heart for the blog!

BODY:
quite a long weekend, and quite a lot to report upon which i'll try to divy up into a per-day kind of entries! and just for fun, let's see where my money went...

day 1, 7/13:

yes it's friday the 13th, but as my mom said `13 is a lucky number for us chinese.`

whether or not that's true or not, i think i've just settled over accepting that as fact, and thus it has never really bothered me since.

today was the day of the leaver's ceremony for alts (my job) from shizuoka prefecture. naturally we are divided into municipal/private and kencho, well i guess not naturally, but you get the idea.

and in case you were ever wondering, wearing a suit and tie in july, in japan can get really really hot.

so getting back from work, i changed, and headed out the door again to a simple ceremony of the municipal/private jets who are leaving. we were also asked to give a speech in japanese.

bus fare to and back from the station: 600yen.
train fare back and fourth: 710yen.

now i can teach 21 kids, i can teach 41 kids, and i can talk to 50+ of my peers without a hitch, but for some reason, i could not stop shaking as i gave my little 3 minute speech (memorized!) in keigo!

afterwards i headed home, and then up to tokyo where i met annabelle and chris for this really really nifty soba/izakaya spot in ebisu, <a href="http://www.gridskipper.com/travel/tokyo/nakamura-gen-tokyos-incognito-restaurant-194830.php">nakamura gen</a>, that's apparently run out of a normal looking apartment building with no signs or anything. you just walk up to the door and push.

originally we all thought it was a soba specialty shop, but they really only have one soba item on the menu... and a LOT of alcohol.

minus the 3000yen price tag, it was a pretty cool experience.

train ticket to tokyo: 2520yen.
2x unagi pies (for itou sensei, my jp teacher who's visiting family in nagoya now) and some random onigiris and waters for my trip up: 2500yen.
random train fares: 600yen.

oh yeah, and the waitress was cute.

:o

total spent: 9930yen.

BODY:
awoken by a 4:05am wakeup call, but it's all ok, you want to know why (not like you have a choice^^)?

cause i got to ride the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nozomi_%28Shinkansen%29">NOZOMOI</a> for the first time AND aboard the brand spanking new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N700">N700</a> shink BABY!

/dies! and it has that new shink smell!
/diesagain!

just ask chris or annabelle, i was giddier than a japanese high school student who just found out that new disney merchandise dropped!

but twas all for naught! as we pulled into kyoto station and tackled the great beast which has eluded me for two years in a never ending chase across the isles of JAPAN (ok not really, but bear with me)!!!

cost of shink ticket: 13000yen.

after grabbing an early breakfast, we set off!

breakfast: 380yen.

first on the list, a temple north of kyoto station. h...something or another... (yes this is actually how cultured i am), but followed by 1001 and buddhas! 1001 was cool, it was a singular large buddha surrounded by 500 similar buddhas on each side, each more or less the same, as well as deities in front of the army of said buddhas! too bad we couldn't take any pictures though.

1001 buddhas: 600yen.

making our way northward, we found ourselves up at kiyomizudera temple, the only temple from japan nominated to be one of the new 7 wonders of world; my bet is because it has that ultraviolet purifier where the 3 fountains are... i could be wrong though.

chris drank from the far right fountain, i the middle, and the little 5 year old girl after me spit it all out haha.

kiyomizudera temple: 300yen.
lunch: 1000yen.
souvenir at a really really nice pottery shop: 4200yen.

we grabbed a quick lunch and headed up through gion, the yasaka shrine, and through maruyama park where chris proceeded to make friends with the ducks by sheltering them from the typhoon rains that were hitting us.

he then proceeded to tip the umbrella onto said sheltered duck, drenching him (didn't check to be honest) thorougly... this lead to the question:

do ducks get annoyed by the rain?

making our way north, we found ourselves at chion-in temple, which though i went, soon learned afterwards that it was a lot larger than we had anticipated (but i think most of it was under construction). in the pouring rain, most everything starts to lose a bit of appeal seeing as how it means standing longer in the rain (i love rain though).

our final stop of the day was nazenji temple, where, i must say, this was probably my faovrite of all of them. nazenji is noted for their zen rock gardens and with the ambiance (love that word) of the rain it was just so tranquil and calming that, quite literally, chris fell asleep. 

nazenji temple: 500yen.

with that, we headed back to our hostel and checked in.

subwayfares: 1000yen.
hostel checkin: 6300yen.

where we proceeded to find a place to have dinner. everyone seemed to be up for homestyle cooking so i made some phone calls that went like this:

guy: hello, thanks for calling, this is waraji-te.
me: yes, good evening, i was wondering if we could make a reseravtion please (inet said to have a jp speaker to make reservations, i was nominated in a purely democratic election).
guy: sorry, we're full.
me: ok thanks. /hangsup.

me: yeah, so they're full.
chris: well what about tomorrow?
me: ... <--- why didn't i think of that?

guy: hello thanks for calling, this is waraji-te.
me: yes, um, good evening... you've never heard me before and i you, but i was wondering if i could make a reservation for a party of 3 tomorrow night?
guy: ...sorry, we're closed tomorrow night.
me: ok... thanks. /hangsup.

me: yeah... they're closed lol.
annabelle: well what about monday night?
me: ... <--- why didn't i think of that... again!?

guy: hello thanks for calling, this is waraji-te.
me (faking an accent): hello, yes, good evening to you sir, would you happen to be able to take a reservation for 3 on the evening of the day that is known as monday?
guy: mmm... sorry, we're closed for the national holiday.
me: i see... thank you again. /hangsup.

we eneded up on indian food, ajanta, A+++ btw!

dinner: 1700yen.

total spent today: 29000yen.

Near my hometown, in an even <i>smaller</i> place called Talmage, there's the City of 10,000 Buddhas.  The temple is very impressive.

Good question about ducks.  I don't know.

And I totally laughed at the reservations thing, cos I've done that before myself.  Heh.

BODY:
we all agreed upon sleeping in today as the day before was just a bit much.

though chris continued to sleep in heh.

annabelle and i headed back up to nazenji to get some pictures (we took a shot in front of nazenji, and, i kid you not, 3 groups took the exact same shot after us!) as well as walk the path of philosophy to ginkakuji. and guess what! BLUE SKY!!! we have a picture of said triumphant moment!

breakfast at conbini: 140yen.
subway fare: 250yen.

the walk was pretty cool. i mean it was along this old canal that had both this paved walkway and a kind of cobblestone walkway
with the japanese maples and cherry blossom trees canopying the surrounding areas created quite the effect. the small shops and cafes that lined the walk way before ginkakuji left you with a very mom and pop homey feeling that gave you a warm, almost nurturing embrace that made the humidity not as awful as it was.bottom line, it was nice.

there was one cafe, that if you're walking north from nazenji, that it smelled of baked apples and cinnamon, and it had a red canopy with the words `coffe & cake` written above with alabaster walls. cakes were 150yen, but we never had time, it's about halfway up the walk on your left. i hope someone (or myself one day) gets a chance to go there.

and finally we arrived at ginkakuji: 500yen.

walking around it, there was a nice rustic pavillion near a pond that i thought made a good shot. we walked around the garden a bit after that, and personally i thought it was gorgeous. i really really really love japanese maples and how they canopy over everything, almost more efficiently than american maples (if there is such a thing lol). but i think the conversation we have sums it up:

me: wow this is really nice!
annabelle: yeah, you ready to head out?
me: wait what? we haven't even seen the silver pavillion yet!
annabelle: uh... yeah we have.
me: when?
annabelle: remember that rustic old pavillion near the pond?
me: ...
annabelle: ...uh, yeah.
me: can we go back so i can get a picture in front of it? :D

next up was lunch. and i have to say, it was all kind of awesome! an udon shop called `omen` that is located behind the bus parking lot. they serve udon sets where everything is given separately: soup, noodles, veggies, sesame seeds, all that good stuff! i think pictures speak a lot better than i can...

lunch at omen: 1250yen.

btw, annabelle REALLY likes gobou.

i mean i do too... but she ate it all :[

(i'm just giving her a hard time, i had my share heh)

next on the list was kinkakuji, the golden pavillion, almost, the symbol of kyoto (in my eyes anyways). we jumped the bus to meet chris there; kyoto has quite possibly one of the poorest metro systems in japan that i've seen... BUT to compensate they have by far one of the best bus systems i've seen!

bus ride: 220yen. <---- good call on that btw annabelle!
souvenirs: 3000yen.

we met up with chris at kinkakuji and made our way to the gold (painted, seriously) pavillion to take the picture that everyone and their mother takes when they're there. serious. i mean everyone AND their mother was there!

i will say this much though, i liked ginkakuji a lot more than kinkakuji. i mean not only is the surrounding garden nicer to look at, but the fact that it's not silver, a much more rustic, authentic kind of look fit in a lot more with the surrounding areas than kinkaku which stuck out a bit like a sore thumb. i mean it was nice, but silver wins this one.

kinkakuji: 300yen.

heading south, we followed another one of the kyoto walks towards ryoanji temple, which apparently has another famous rock garden.

ryoanji temple: 500yen.

to be honest, it was nice, i still preferred nazenji a lot more because it was smaller, but i mean let's be honest, the real reason people come here is to, well, sleep.

now off to arashiyama for annabelle's adventure! last time she was here she got a taste of tofu ice cream, and was really looking forward to coming back here for that. so we boarded this little private train (i have a picture of me on the tracks, that's how little this train line is) and made our way over. the big plus about this train is that no matter how far you go, it's a set price.

/co-jrlearnsomethingfromthis!-ugh: 200yen.

upon arrival we headed south towards the bridge only to find that it wasn't there. we were losing daylight and all was looking in despair until we headed back across the bridge towards the station we arrived at and annabelle had a moment of, er what's that word... you know, when you all of a sudden are able to remember something?

i really need to get out of this country...

anyhoo, we made our way across and suddenly she sprinted ahead exclaiming, `HERE IT IS!!!!`

tofu ice cream: 250yen.

now i know what you're thinking... tofu ice cream? and i know what else you're thinking... yes, it very much so tastes like tofu.

it's not bad, really.

we made our way back to shi-jo for the gion festival in hopes to find a tonkatsu place (ahhh comfort food). the gion festival was absolutely nuts though, i don't think i've ever seen so many people packed along the streets before, but after a long and tiring search, we found what we were looking for! mmm katsu <3.

train ride back: 200yen.
katsu: 1300yen.

finally we wrapped up the night along the river side. it was a gorgeous night with performers all along the banks, but especially this one trepe that performed a kind of jazz that i must say, really really fit the atmosphere; almost like it was speaking to me.

p.s. thanks for the beer chris. twas good.

total spent: 8120yen.

Did you know that 金閣寺 didn't used to be all bright and shiny gold?  It originally was, but it all flaked off and no one bothered to maintain it.  Then some crackpot monk burned it down.  (Which is what Mishima's first-person perspective of the novel of the same name is about, btw.  Good novel, too.)  When they reconstructed it they decided to keep it golden, and as such there've been a <i>ton</i> more tourists since.

I never got around to seeing 銀閣寺.  I probably should next time I'm down.

Tofu ice-cream?  Wow.  I've not had that before; I'd like to try it.  The tofu donuts they sell up here at the tiny tofu shop somewheres in Shimokita are pretty good.

almost there! bear with me on this one!

annabelle and i got up early again, as chris opted to sleep in again. we made our way to inari shrine in hopes that the day would be good enough to visit the fushimi inari shrine and it's famous 1000 tori gates or so. if any of you have seen memoirs of a geisha, this that scene when she's a child and running around, well, 1000 tori gates.

breakfast at a small french bread shop: 140yen.
train ticket to inari station: 140yen.

upon arriving at the station we exited to find only that we are greeted by a HUGE tori gate.

1

we continued up the path only to find another tori gate.

2

beginning our hike, we soon ran into the scene from memoirs of a geisha: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15... i got bored around of counting around here. :P

in summary: the maps there of the local area are <strong>absolutely useless</strong>. you will not find where the heck you are at any given point in time, let alone the correct path to follow in hopes of finding your destination. there are no signs, just, a <strong>lot</strong> and i do stress `a lot` of tori gates... and every path more or less looks the same with a stone walkway and, well, a lot of gates.

oh yeah, and the punks sell 500 ml bottles of everything for 250 yen.

i bought one btw: 250yen.

annabelle and i walked around and were practically lost (i.e. maps useless) until we finally found ourselves back where we started, 2 hours later and unanimously agreed:

if anyone ever asked `oh, did you see the [insertwhateverisfamousthere]?`

we'd say `yes.`

making our way back to kyoto station we had lunch at an italian place before meeting up with chris. we walked the nishki market (packed and free samples galore!) and chilled in a book store (i read my favorite book, <em>the things they carried</em> by tim o'brien) while having danta! twas a happy way to end this trip by just relaxing and not feeling in a rush to get anywhere.

train ride back: 140yen.
lunch: 2000yen. <--- we were STARVING!
subway fares: 590yen.

and finally back to kyoto station, with bags in hand, and for chris to accomplish is ultimate goal.

now a little background information: chris LOVES ramen. he fell in love with it (as far as i'm aware) when he arrived in japan, and it is his meal of choice. that being said, we told him in the isetan nearby, there's a floor of ramen shops.

his ultimate goal: eat 3 bowls.

which he did might i add.

annabelle and i joined him for the first bowl, but afterwards we went to have green tea parfait...

chris joined us an hour later, quite possibly the happiest i've seen him, ever.

dinner that night: 450yen.

we headed back to the station where we bid each other farewell; for them, they were heading back to work and i was off to local it to nagoya in preparation for my continuing trip, like i said, quite possibly the busiest weekend for me, ever.

oh yeah, and because of japan, omiyage: 2600yen.

with that, i jumped the train to nagoya, local, and found myself there at 10:40pm: 2520yen.

running through my memory, i found my capsule hotel, grabbed a quick dinner at some random katsu place, and promptly passed out, giving into the exhaustion that i had been fending off for the last three and a half days.

capsule: 3900yen.
cheap dinner: 1200yen.

total spent: 13930yen.

last day, here we go!

like i did last year around this time, i met my japanese teacher from ucsd, itou sensei, in nagoya. this year, she is in japan again, and again, i made my way out to visit her.

i think the best i could say was that it was really really good to see her again. kind of, another year come full circle. we were able to talk a lot, and mninus her dismay at my japanese getting worse (serious, i've completely forgotten things i should have remembered first year), we had a really good time; i introduced her to the joys of unagi pie!

though, i do apologize that i spent a lot of the time talking...

but a big thank you to her for helping me figuring stuff out and a big thank you for lending me an ear. i was, and am really happy that i got a chance to meet up with her again, especially to be able to in japan nonetheless! we had a really late lunch, and i bought some omiyage for my teachers as i said goodbye with a hug and boarded the last shink that i would ride this time in japan.

subway fare back: 150yen.
late late lunch: 1000yen.
omiyage: 1050yen.
shink ticket: 7560yen.

but for me, it's not quite over yet...

upon arriving at mishima, i transferred to the izuhakone to finish the final leg of my trip. a dinner and karaoke session with ryan at our favorite restaurant owned by our friend teru, tony's to da max.

izuhakone ticket: 210yen.

now i was completely unprepared for what happened next.

when we walked in, we were greeted by souichiro and teru, but for once it was a serious kind of greeting, almost a finality to it all. he lead us to our usual seats and we found two packages, three items in each written out towards ryan and me.

teru and souichiro told us to open them, and we found a good luck charm that teru said would protect us so long as we kept it with us. a t-shirt that none of us knew how to read, but we agreed that the meaning of it all was that it's `too all the good friends that we've met and all the great memories we've shared, and that it never is `goodbye,` only `see you later`` and the last bit, that almost moved me to tears. almost. teru gave each of us two cards and wrote a personal message on both.

we chatted the night away, almost 5 hours there until we had to say goodbye.

he told us this meal was on the house.

but ryan and i weren't finished yet. what insued was a really good reason why concerts are usually no more than 2 hours long.

we karaoked for four hours finishing at 3am!

and it was good.

though it wasn't free, but it was relatively cheap: 1700yen.

it's the first time i missed the last train home, the first time i voluntarily took the first train home, and the closest i've pulled an all nighter in japan.

we made it back to ryan's place, and i promptly passed out.

total spent: 10670yen.

Yay!  A great big おつかれさまでした！ to you.  ^_^  Thanks for writing about it; fun read.  Brings back my own Kansai memories too, seeing similar places and whatnot.

And hey, if you saw the sun rise it counts as an all-nighter, does it not?

today was the last day of school for the first quarter.

in addition to every beginning and ending of each term, the school likes to do opening and closing ceremonies respectively, but this time there was an extra little slot for me.

it was for my farewell speech.

i told them all that the only reason why i didn't want to go back was because of them. that english is within their reach and that all they have to do is try. that i hope that they have found a place in their hearts for me because they all have a place in mine...

and then i spent the last three hours or so talking with my students, as many as i could find, taking 13809752908520937520935782035 pictures in the process... everyone telling me to write, thank you, to take care, to try my best, to come back, to not go back to america...

it's hard to believe that two years is finally coming to a close neh.

it was a good day today.

one that i'll never forget.

One thing, will you at least read my own winding down before I leave Japan posts, once I finally start writing them?  It's been nice reading yours, and I kinda hope you'll read mine too, eventually.

just got back from climbing mt. fuji with aga.

we started out at 10pm taking a total of about 6.5 hrs to reach the top, stopping 1.5-2 hrs at the rest stops inbetween mostly because we didn't want to wait at the top; which is freezing if you didn't know.

oh yeah, and it was pouring rain and windy as hell ;P BUT there was one really nice moment when the clouds parted and you could see the stars, twas nice.

not much to say except that i've been up for about 26 hrs, and still running on a bit of an o2 high.

all in all, glad neither of us had altitude sickness, and glad we both got to finally do it.

we're both alive, in one piece, well minus the times i 'died' about 11.5 times and her 5.5 times (slipping on the rocks, and falling on our arses), i swear my ankles and knees are completely shot..., and the time when we completely went off trail with a group of japanese tourists and a veteran climber (3 times she said), but eventually forged our way back!

but despite the rain and wind, we got to see a sunrise and a feeling of accomplishment... and finding that there is a post office at the TOP of mt. fuji.

you've got to be kidding me.

but as we made our way down, and an interesting sense of comradery overcame most everyone on that mountain. that we were all bound into this one crazy idea that `hey, we can scale mount fuji!` whether it be coming to the top together with the veterans, the hardcore groups who are dressed from head to toe with rain gear and head lamps and full rucksacks, or greeting each other on the way down from the youngest of children to the oldest of grandparents, to the other foreigners and the japanese self-defense force (who are prime examples of politeness and respect for those older than you), or from returning from your all night trek and seeing all the eager faces tackle the monumental task that you just finished not so long ago.

there was this genuine-ness of everyone's personalities and demeaner that put nothing but the largest grin on my face as i realize that i truly am going to miss all of this as the days roll down.

and finally after the long journey back, i parted ways with my white k-swisses, the shoes that have been with me for the last two years, who have seen just as much as i have, who have climbed the great wall, scaled the temples of angkor, walked along the streets of thailand, and back again, have been retired into a bin outside of fujinoimya station labeled `burnable.` perhaps the only real fitting end.

what to say indeed.

last night was ryan's last night in japan. though he isn't leaving till the 26th, he's heading to tokyo as i'm writing this.

now the thing is, i know it's not the last time i'm going to see him cause, well, i'm flying to wisconsin 8/4 to drive down to tuscon with him arriving 8/10, but, well...

if you know me fairly well, then you know this will shock you a bit (in a good way of course), that the two people that i've met on jet that i've bonded the closest with were not asian at all. i mean don't get me wrong, i have a fair share of asian friends here, but ryan was (cause he left) the kind of guy who almost felt like family. i mean we've traveled all over south east asia together, we've done trips to tokyo, kamakura, nikko, we've chatted on end, karaoked for 4 hrs, eaten till we felt like dying, and more or less done it all.

i don't think words i can say here will describe just how amazing and how important our friendship is to me, and i know this all sounds cheesey, but i really do mean every word of it.

even though i know i'll see him in 10 days, i want to wish him the best in his life as a grad student at ua, and hope nothing but good things for him. he's been an amazing friend whom i've had the great privelage of getting to know him far beyond the shallow layers of acquaintances.

and i look forward to our road trip across the country.

oh yeah, i know what to say now.

thank you.

i had my last iaido lesson tonight, and i was honestly touched...

it's been a great 7 months, and i've had a fantastic (said with a british accent) time! a big thank you to usami sensei for taking me under his wing, for showing me a part of japanese culture that i was so desparately seeking, for taking time out of his day to help me get my uniform and talking with me, a big thanks to watanabe san and iketani san for teaching me one on one, and a thank you to john for inviting me to participate.

my greatest regret in leaving japan, is that i only had 7 months with this wonderful group, but i am forever grateful for those 7 months at the same time.

お世話になりました。

that if what you want to say comes from the heart, everyone can understand it, regardless of the language it's spoken.

tonight i had my farewell enkai from my teachers at yoshi shou. though only 5 teachers showed up, they were 5 teachers that i was incredibly close to; fukushima sensei, tajima sensei, tomono sensei, oya sensei, and goto sensei.

now most of you may know them from a lot of my stories, but tonight was different. they all said thank you for the last two years, but that wasn't the thing that got to me the most, and i can't quite place my finger on it.

after awhile, and a few pints, i said that i wanted to say something. i told each one of them why they were special to me, why they meant a lot to me, and more importantly that because of amazing people like you, i could have come this far. i don't really know how to describe in words how i felt, but i had to pause many times to stop myself from crying. i once thought of how happy i would be to leave this stinky little town of mine, but tonight i found it so impossible to tell them that i'm leaving even though everyone knew.

even though i knew.

i'm really am glad to have stayed a second year. i'm really am glad to have had the opportunity to meet these wonderful people. and i'm really thankful that these people were the group of japanese people that i was able to meet during my tenure here. it may not have been perfect or ideal, but what situation is you know?

so, from the bottom of my heart, thank you. i know that i've been saying it a lot, but i've meant it everytime i say it.

thank you. i wish you all the best in your futures, and thank you all for the wonderful experience that i will forever remember as my time in japan.

i never liked 'goodbyes.' i never will to be honest. but i guess way to put is this:

this is not 'goodbye,' this is 'see you later.'

tonight was my iaido farewell enkai.

as i said before, my only real regret is that i could not stay another year with these wonderful people.

however.

i also realize that coming back home is what's best for me at my current time in life. i need to come home, i need to touch base, i want to continue moving forward in my life, and as much as i love jet, it does not help me accomplish that aspect of my life.

but there's something you all really need to understand.

that before i found this group, almost a year ago, my friend ryan recommended that i join a cultural aspect of japan, that i could not leave without having do so. but nothing seemed right. i tried taiko for a few weeks, however their pace didn't seem to allow new comers to find their place amongst the experienced. desparately i tried finding other medians that not only focused on japanese culture, but also my own interest.

and that's when i was introduced to iaido. that's when i met these absolutely amazing people for the last 7 months. people such as usasmi sensei, watanabe san, iketani san who took me under their influence to start from the very beginning and teach me everything i would need to know. who told me when i was in error (truly the sign of great teachers), and more so caring that i succed at what i did. if any of you ever get the chance to meet these people, i implore you to spend time with them and talk to them, for i can guarantee you'll learn something.

i am forever grateful to this opportunity that was presented to me, and as i said before, my only regret is that another year could not have passed with these people.

thank you. for everything. for giving me a chance. for teaching me. for letting me experience a part of your culture to the fullest and for caring that i understood it and did well in it.

i'll always remember you guys for you will probably never fully understand what you all have meant to me.

BODY:
at the end of my iaido enkai last night, my sensei offered to take me fishing in the bay near fuji. he told me that he'd pick me up at 3:00am to go and that we'd be back in time by 6:00am or so.

i couldn't fall asleep till about 1:30am last night, and woke up an hour later to go fishing...

we only caught one fish.

and it was a baby.

and at first i was thinking of highly suggesting that we throw it back from whence it came as to, you know, not overfish and what not. then i also remembered that my teacher got 4 hrs of sleep, took his boat, bought ice, and stayed up for two to three hours with me trying to catch fish...

i kept my mouth shut haha.

anyways after that i got back, passed out for an hour again as i was headed up to tokyo to meet up with masaya for the last time.

to my joy and surprise he brought his senpai, hirayama san (or yasu) and his wife (orie). and let me tell you, i haven't seen masaya in a year since he left for germany a year ago around this time. he invited me to nagano to go snow boarding and always opened his door if we needed a place to crash in tokyo. for just that alone, i am grateful. but more importantly he's been an amazing friend and genuine about his effort and want to speak english and be my friend as well.

we had lunch, went shopping, played mario kart with the four of us (awesome btw!) and went to shoot pool.

which i think was the highlight.

we played 2v2 and it was me and hirayama san and masaya and hirayama san's wife. yasu and i were the underdogs, going 0-2 (no thanks to me, the f-up count is me 3 and him 1 lol), but with a turn of events (his wife sunk the 8 ball on the second shot), and quite possibly a miracle shot from yasu san, we tied it up 2-2 and could leave it happy knowing that we (yasu and i) were not completely creamed.

some of the most fun i've had in a long time, honest.

then we made our way up to nerima, where for 4 straight times, the elusive katsu shop has, well, eluded me. literally.

i also learned about this place from yasu a year and some change ago.

the story behind it is that melissa and i came up here after recontracting orientation and we... ended up not ordering the katsu (even though we thought we did)... and then the next time mel and i and chris found it was closed, and then mel, chris, annabelle, and i found it was closed, and then (though i can't remember) but i have this feeling that a fourth time it was closed as well, but i FINALLY got my katsu!!!

huzzah!

and it was absolutely delicious.

but one thing really got to me that i didn't even realize.

for you see i thought that masaya was in tokyo just to look for a job and that he's been here for a long time... and then he told me that he came out here, all the way from nagano, just to come see me.

and you know what else he did? even though it was completely out of the way, he stayed on the train with me to shinagawa and even waited for my train.

that's the kind of amazing guy he is and i only hope that all of you guys reading this will only get a chance to someday meet him.

he's an amazing friend who i'll never be able to forget, and the night that i got to share with them as my final night in tokyo was some of the best fun that i've been able to have in japan and i'm glad it was with them.

though i do admit that my biggest regret was that i didn't take any pictures while we were shooting pool

you know those moments where you and some good friends have a long good laugh that goes on for a long time, only to find all of you with teary eyes, difficulty breathing, a pain in your sides and just the greatest feeling of contentment afterwards?

that's what the whole night was like.

thank you. first and foremost, a big thank you to angela for hosting it for two years, and letting me keep my 11mb nook in her 2gig cranny. to japan/clair/everyoneinjapan for making it all possible. and to all of you for reading my ramblings. clearly i was doing something right if i could hold your attentions to either subscribe to my rss feed or simply bookmark this page. it's always brought me great joy to discover that someone new whom i didn't expect was reading this blog and it only motivated me moreso to try and keep it up to date as often as possible. though at times i know it was slow, i'm glad to say though that i've kept it drama free and only about the fun instances that i've had in japan that i will always remember and keep close to me always.

but this is the last entry for my blog.

becuase by this time tomorrow, or even more likely, by the time you read this i'll actually be home.

not my apartment in fuji japan home, i mean home home.

in my own home, in my own bed, with family, with friends, with oscar, with trash cans.

i've more or less spent the last few weeks saying my goodbyes to everyone whom i wanted to say goodbye to, and yet even so it feels like i'm forgetting some people. even so, it never really is `goodbye` is it. it's more of a `see you later` kind of feeling to it.

it's hard to actually imagine how many lives you can be a part of and how many of theirs can be a part of yours, and that it never really boils down to it until you see what happens when you have to part ways for a potentially infinite amount of time.

but to everyone i've met, and to every place i've been, and to every thing i've done while here in japan, it's almost surreal that this day has finally come; my last day in japan.

at this time two years ago, i arrived in japan starry eyed and filled with a sense of motivation i have not felt in a long while. a sense of excitement that begged me to run around to look behind every corner to see if there was something new to discover. though the starryness has faded from my eyes quite some time ago, i still find myself with that sense of curiosity and adventure. almost a kind of wanderlust that has been instilled into my very being just by being here.

but more importantly, to me anyways.

as eager as i was to start anew and see what life here had in store for me, there was a slight twang of doubt, a small nagging quesetion of whether or not i could do it, if i could survive. if the very things that i had hoped to accomplish before i came to japan and even then the things i hoped to have accomplished while in japan always worried me in the sense of that i might find myself on this day with a sense of, well, regretting japan.

and as ominous, for lack of a better word really, as that may seem, i find myself here at work on my very last full day with my bags overstuffed and possibly breaking and no real clue how i'm going to get everything home, i can sit here with one of the largest grins on my face knowing that,

i did it.

p.s. i won every one of those bets.

p.p.s. i'm just sad no one actually put any money on them :[.

p.p.p.s. with a heavy heart, and a big hug.

it almost makes me wonder "how many of you are actually going to read this?"

today is the day that i arrived at yoshisho for the graduation ceremony of my class. now when i say 'my class' i mean in the sense that i taught this class from beginning to end; whereas the two other classes i taught, were only for two and one quarter respectively.

i wanted to write this epilogue because i felt it's a final final entry for my time on the jet program. that this marks the true end and that after this date, there is nothing left for me in the town of fuji. it seemed like a very fitting way to wrap this all up.

i'll admit it, i was nervous from the start. from about a week and some change before, it finally hit me that i was heading for japan again in a few days, and that for the most part, i've virtually avoided airports at all cost for the entire year of 2008. i didn't really know what to expect: would they remember me? would any one care? did i leave as great an impression on them as they did me? would i recognize any of them? did i get the day of the graduation right? would i look back on this as a huge mistake?

let's get one thing straight though.

i'm going there for myself and myself alone. and, that today was their day, not mine- it was a day that i wanted to be more of an observer than the center of attention (unlike my last few days there).

that being said, i arrived in japan half a day before they would graduate and though i didn't have problems falling asleep the night before, i found myself wide awake at 4:30, coursing with adrenaline. and it only got better.

let's take a step back. i was also scared of japan. it's been such a long time, that i was worried if i'd completely crap my pants with navigating myself around the maze of trains and streets. that i'd have forgotten everything that had happened almost two years ago, and that it would be stressful and frustrating beyond my most wild imaginations.

to say the least, coming back to japan was like finding that pair of old jeans that you have that you thought you'd never see again and trying them on. and finding it fit like a glove (you know, where your ass doesn't look too big and you're not muffin-topping. i think i'm going to coin that phrase from now on).

as we got on the shink (which i still get quite the stiffy for), it didn't really really hit me till we hit mishima, and i started remembering everything that had happened the last time i was there: tony's runs, visiting ryan and brad, onsening, traveling, the works.

it really really started smacking me in the face when we got to shin-fuji and i got in the cab, telling them to head towards 'yoshisho'.

and i think i just about shit a brick when i was walking to through the front gates of my school w/ everyone in the school office looking at me slack jawed and, a more literal translation, "no. fucking. way".

i even tripped on the steps up to the third floor, where my students (now san nen sei) were.

heart beating, both excited and nervous and scared, i made eye contact with (who used to be 1-5 gumi) sayuri.

"JEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEFU!!!!!!!!!!"

with the entire class erupting in the same fashion. then as i made my rounds to each class room, a similar, to say the least, result ensued.

my heart melted and i just about died in my sandals.

which were bigger than what they used to be.

thank gawd.

every one of my worries faded away as i watched my students graduate in tears. as i took pictures with a lot of them, as i signed some of their yearbooks, to which they replied "that's cool! but i can't read that", and even the two students that i really wanted to see, came up and asked to take pictures with me, just put the biggest smile on my face.

i was really worried about this trip. that my previous bitterness might overwhelm me and leave me despising not only my town, my school, japan, but that i would have a chip on my shoulder from my years on jet.

to my surprise and elation, i found myself missing fuji as my brother and i boarded the shink. with an urge to stay a few more days in my dingy town to relive some of the sights and sounds (and smells :[).

my brother says that that's a good thing that i feel that way, and that it's better to leave on a high note.

i'd have to agree.

though this is the main purpose of my trip this time to japan, i like to think of this as the icing on the cake of my years on jet. i know that there's still so much to do (kobe, hiroshima, himeji, tokyo), but being here today to watch them bring everything around in full circle has left me with nothing but a warm fuzzy feeling inside and a (slight) sadness that i'll most likely never see them again.

and because of today, i'm ok with that, really.

頑張ってね、私の生徒達。

i'm so proud of you all.
